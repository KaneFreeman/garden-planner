This will provide the cold  period that they need in order to germinate.</li>\r\n  <li>Once chilled, plant seeds \u00bc inch deep in  individual pots 6-8 weeks before last expected frost. </li>\r\n  <li>Seedlings emerge in 14-21 days.</li>\r\n  <li>As soon as seedlings emerge, provide plenty of  light on a sunny windowsill or grow seedlings 3-4 inches beneath fluorescent  plant lights turned on 16 hours per day, off for 8 hours at night. Raise the  lights as the plants grow taller. Incandescent bulbs will not work for this  process because they will get too hot. Most plants require a dark period to  grow, do not leave lights on for 24 hours.</li>\r\n  <li>Seedlings do not need much fertilizer, feed when  they are 3-4 weeks old using a starter solution (half strength of a complete  indoor houseplant food) according to manufacturer&rsquo;s directions. </li>\r\n  <li>If you are growing in small cells, you may need  to transplant the seedlings to 3 or 4 inch pots when seedlings have at least 3  pairs of leaves before transplanting to the garden so they have enough room to  develop strong roots</li>\r\n  <li>Before planting in the garden, seedling plants  need to be &ldquo;hardened off&rdquo;. Accustom young plants to outdoor conditions by  moving them to a sheltered place outside for a week. Be sure to protect them  from wind and hot sun at first. If frost threatens at night, cover or bring  containers indoors, then take them out again in the morning. This hardening off  process toughens the plant&rsquo;s cell structure and reduces transplant shock and  scalding.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Planting in the  Garden:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>Select  a location in full sun with deep, fertile, well-drained soil. In hot areas,  afternoon shade is helpful.</li>\r\n  <li>Prepare  the bed by turning the soil under to a depth of 8 inches. Level with a rake to  remove clumps of grass and stones. </li>\r\n  <li>Set  plants 3-4 feet apart in rows 4-5 feet apart.</li>\r\n  <li>Dig  a hole for each plant large enough to amply accommodate the root ball.\u00a0 </li>\r\n  <li>Carefully  remove the plant from its pot and gently loosen the root ball with your hands  to encourage good root development. </li>\r\n  <li>Fill  the planting hole with soil to the top and press soil down firmly with your  hand leaving a slight depression around the plant to hold water. </li>\r\n  <li>Use  the plant tag as a location marker. This is particularly important if you are  trying different varieties. It is very difficult to tell which variety is which  from the foliage.\u00a0\u00a0 </li>\r\n  <li>Water  thoroughly, so that a puddle forms in the saucer you have created. This settles  the plants in, drives out air pockets and results in good root-to-soil contact.</li>\r\n  <li>Mulch  deeply to keep the soil as cool as possible.</li>\r\n</ul>'

Buds are deformed. <strong>\u00a0<em>Burpee Recommends: Remove affected plants. Contact  your Cooperative Extension Service for recommendations.</em></strong><br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Botrytis: </strong>This  fungus causes a grey mold on flowers, leaves, stems and buds. It thrives in  cool wet weather conditions.<strong> <em>Burpee Recommends: Remove affected plant  parts, avoid watering at night and getting water on the plant when watering.  Make sure plants have good air circulation. Contact your Cooperative Extension  Service for fungicide recommendations. </em></strong><br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Damping Off: </strong>This  is one of the most common problems when starting plants from seed. The seedling  emerges and appears healthy; then it suddenly wilts and dies for no obvious  reason. Damping off is caused by a fungus that is active when there is abundant  moisture and soils and air temperatures are above 68 degrees F. Typically, this  indicates that the soil is too wet or contains high amounts of nitrogen  fertilizer. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Keep seedlings moist but do not overwater; avoid  over-fertilizing your seedlings; thin out seedlings to avoid overcrowding; make  sure the plants are getting good air circulation; if you plant in containers,  thoroughly wash them in soapy water and rinse in a ten per cent bleach solution  after use.</em></strong><br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Powdery Mildew: </strong>This fungus disease occurs on the top of the leaves in humid weather  conditions. The leaves appear to have a whitish or greyish surface and may  curl.<strong> <em>Burpee Recommends: Avoid powdery mildew by providing good air  circulation for the plants by good spacing and pruning. Contact your  Cooperative Extension Service for fungicide recommendations. </em></strong><br>\n  <br>\n<strong>Verticillium Wilt: </strong>This fungus causes a wilting of the leaves and stems on several branches.  Leaf margins cup upward, leaves turn yellow and drop off. If fruit if buds are  produced, they are usually smaller than normal. Like fusarium wilt, this will  enter through the roots, migrating up the stem and plugging a plant's transport  vessels. It is transmitted in the soil. It can also be spread by water and  tools. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Practice at  least a 4 year crop rotation. Remove and burn crop debris. </em></strong><strong></strong></p>\n<h3><br>\n  <strong>Common Pests and Cultural Problems:</strong><br>\n</h3>\n<p><strong>Aphids: </strong>Greenish, red, black or peach colored sucking  insects can spread disease as they feed on the undersides of leaves. They leave  a sticky residue on foliage that attracts ants. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends:  Introduce or attract natural predators into your garden such as lady beetles  and wasps which feed on aphids. You can also wash them off with a strong spray,  or use an insecticidal soap. </em></strong><br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Armyworm</strong>:  Holes in leaves can be singular or clumped together. Leaves can become  skeletonized. Egg clusters may be evident on foliage with a cottony or fuzzy  appearance. Young larvae are pale green and adults are darker with a light line  along the side<strong> </strong>and pink underside. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Introduce  natural enemies to the area.</em></strong><br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Flea Beetles: </strong>These  small hopping beetles feed on plant foliage and may spread diseases. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Rotate crops with plants  in a different plant family. Use floating row covers to prevent damage to young  foliage.</em></strong> <br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Leafminers: </strong>These insects bore  just under the leaf surface causing irregular serpentine lines. The larvae are  yellow cylindrical maggots and the adults are small black and yellow flies.  They do not usually kill plants, but disfigure the foliage.<strong> <em>Burpee  Recommends: Remove affected foliage. </em></strong><br>\n  <br>\n<strong>Slugs: </strong>These  pests leave large holes in the foliage or eat leaves entirely. They leave a  slime trail, feed at night and are mostly a problem in damp weather.<strong> <em>Burpee  Recommends: Hand pick, at night if possible. You can try attracting the slugs  to traps either using cornmeal or beer. For a beer trap, dig a hole in the  ground and place a large cup or bowl into the hole; use something that has  steep sides so that the slugs can&rsquo;t crawl back out when they&rsquo;re finished. Fill  the bowl about \u00be of the way full with beer, and let it sit overnight. In the  morning, the bowl should be full of drowned slugs that can be dumped out for  the birds to eat. For a cornmeal trap, put a tablespoon or two of cornmeal in a  jar and put it on its side near the plants. Slugs are attracted to the scent  but they cannot digest it and it will kill them. You can also try placing a  barrier around your plants of diatomaceous earth or even coffee grounds. They  cannot crawl over these.</em></strong></p>\n<h3>&nbsp; </h3>"

          '<p><strong>I received my plant.  It is damaged: the bottom leaves are broken/limp, what can I do? </strong>This is  entirely normal. Artichoke plants shed their outer leaves as new growth emerges  from the center.<br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>I grew my artichoke  and it didn&rsquo;t flower. </strong>Most varieties (not all) will not produce a crop of  flower buds their first year in your garden. Expect buds the second year and for  up to three years if artichokes are perennial in your area.<br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>I grew my artichoke-it  flowered but didn&rsquo;t fruit. </strong>The edible part of the artichoke is the flower  bud before it opens into the flower. Once the flower opens, it is not edible  anymore (although it is attractive in the garden!)<br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>How do I over winter  my artichoke? </strong>Protect the growing center of the plant with loose straw,  light mulch or leaf mold. Artichokes will rot if the soil they are in does not  drain well.<br>\n  <br>\n<strong>Can I grow artichokes  in containers?</strong> Artichokes grow into large plants and do not tend to grow  well in a container. If containers are your only choice, use a large one at  least 30 inches in diameter and give it extra protection in the winter. </p>\n<h3>&nbsp; </h3>'

          '<ul>\n  <li>Do  NOT harvest asparagus the first year. Allow the plants to grow and make food to  store in the roots for stronger plants the following year. When plants are two  years old you can harvest them for a short period. In the third year you can  harvest for four weeks. </li>\n  <li>Harvest  when new spears emerge in spring. Harvest when spears are about \u00bd inch wide. On  average spears should be 6-8 inches tall.\u00a0 </li>\n  <li>Using  a sharp, clean knife, cut young spears at ground level and set in water with  the cut side down until you are ready to store the spears. Some gardeners  prefer to snap the stems, but this can cause damaged tissue which can result in  disease issues.\u00a0 </li>\n  <li>Harvest  frequently before spears start to leaf out.\u00a0 </li>\n  <li>Do  not harvest spears less than \u00bc inch in diameter. </li>\n  <li>Prepare  as soon as possible as fresh asparagus is best.\u00a0 </li>\n  <li>Asparagus  also freezes well for later use. Sort the spears by thickness and &ldquo;blanch&rdquo;  smaller ones 1 \u00bd minutes, medium for 2 minutes and thickest for 3 minutes. To  do this, drop the spears into boiling water for the recommended time, then  plunge into cold water to stop the cooking, drain and store in freezer bags or  vacuum bags.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>'

          '<strong>Common Disease Problems:</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Asparagus Rust: </strong>This fungus disease causes rust colored spores on the stems and foliage  of asparagus. The plants can appear to have prematurely matured. The disease is  favored by prolonged rainy weather, and attacks the ferns after harvest and is  spread by wind and rain. Severe attacks can result in a decline in crown vigor. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: To avoid rust, plant resistant varieties, such as Mary  Washington</em></strong>. <strong><em>Avoid getting water on the foliage when watering</em></strong>. <strong><em>Remove severely affected foliage</em></strong>. <strong><em>Contact your Cooperative  Extension Service for preventative fungicide recommendations.</em></strong><br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Cercospora Needle Blight: </strong>A fungal disease that affects ferns in mid-season, causing them to die  prematurely. Affected foliage will have small tan to gray oval shaped spots  with reddish edges. The disease spreads in prolonged rainy weather.<strong> <em>Burpee  Recommends: Contact your Cooperative Extension Service for fungicide  recommendations. </em></strong><br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Crown Rot: </strong>Caused  by a soil borne fungus that rots the stems at the soil line. It interferes with  the plants&rsquo; ability to take up nutrients and water and plants will decline and  die. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Do not plant  asparagus in the same area for at least eight years. </em></strong><br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Fusarium Wilt: </strong>A soil borne disease that causes the roots to rot. The infection can  enter the plant through wounds caused by cultivation, insects or harvesting.  The spears will shrivel and ferns turn yellow and wilt. There is no cure for  the disease.<strong> <em>Burpee Recommends: Some varieties are tolerant to the  disease. Do not plant asparagus where this problem has occurred. </em></strong><br>\n  <br>\n<strong>Purple Spot: </strong>This fungus causes  tan to brown lesions to develop on spears. They may coalesce and cause  defoliation. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Contact your Cooperative Extension  Service for fungicide recommendations. </em></strong><strong></strong><br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<h3><strong>Common Pests and Cultural Problems:</strong><br>\n</h3>\n<p><strong>Asparagus Aphids: </strong>These are powdery gray-green colored sucking insects that inject toxins  into the plant as they feed on the undersides of leaves causing the plant to be  stunted and have abnormal growth.<strong> <em>Burpee Recommends: You can wash them  off with a strong spray, or use an insecticidal soap. </em></strong><br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Asparagus Beetle (Common): </strong>The common asparagus beetle adults are \u00bc inch long with black wings with  red margins and three large yellow squarish spots. The larvae are blue-gray  with black heads. They feed on the ferns and weaken the plants. The beetles are  active, but shy, and may drop to the ground or to lower leaves when disturbed,  and they make a squeaking noise when they are caught. They overwinter as adults  and congregate on the young shoots when they emerge in spring. They lay rows of  three to eight black eggs at the ends of the spears and on the foliage. The  eggs hatch in a week and the young larvae feed on the leaf tips to feed. After  two weeks they drop to the soil and change into adults. There are several  generations throughout the growing season. The larvae excrete a black fluid on  the tips, and adult feeding can damage the buds and stems of the young shoots  causing them to be woody and crooked. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: To control, hand  pick, or knock the larvae to the ground by brushing the plants with a broom.  Contact your Cooperative Extension Service for pesticide recommendations. </em></strong><br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Browning Foliage: </strong>This can result from drought stress,  particularly in mid-summer<strong>. <em>Burpee  Recommends: A drip irrigation watering  system and mulch can help control drought stress.</em></strong><br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Cutworms</strong>:  These can feed on the spear tips and sides. The brown to pale yellow larva can  be 2 inches long and lives in the soil. The adults are moths that lay their  eggs in weeds.<strong> <em>Burpee Recommends: Place a paper cup collar (use a coffee  cut with the bottom cut out) around the base of the plant. They are usually  mostly a problem with young seedlings. You can also control by handpicking and  controlling weeds, where they lay their eggs. </em></strong><br>\n  <br>\n<strong>Twelve Spotted Asparagus Beetle: </strong>This beetle is reddish orange with twelve  black spots on its back. Overwintering adults cause damage by feeding on the  tender spring shoots. The eggs are yellowish to light green and are attached by  their sides to the leaves. The young larvae feed on the berries of the female  plant.<strong> <em>Burpee Recommends: Hand pick and contact your local Cooperative  Extension Service for pesticide recommendations. </em></strong></p>'

          'FAQs',
          '\n<p><strong>Do I need male and female plants to get asparagus? </strong>No, we eat the leaf buds of asparagus, there  is no need for pollination or fruiting. Some varieties are mostly male, and  these tend to be stronger varieties. The female plants are not as strong and  produce weedy seedlings, but the spears tend to be larger. <br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Are the red berries edible? Can I tell what sex a plant  will be from the red berry?</strong>\u00a0 No and no. <br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>How can I get that white asparagus I see in gourmet  stores? </strong>White asparagus is not a  specific variety of asparagus; it is regular asparagus that has been blanched  as it grows. Keep the growing green spear from the sunlight and it will turn  white. <br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>How many plants do I need for a family of two? For a  family of four? </strong>We recommend 25  roots for a family of two, 50 for a family of four. <br>\n  <br>\n<strong>I planted my asparagus this spring and want to move them  to a new location, can I do that? </strong>Moving  asparagus once planted is not recommended. The roots planted in spring are  already one year old and need to become established before you can begin  harvesting. Moving them will delay harvest for another year, and be disruptive  to their development. If you must move them move them in fall after the ferns  die back. </p>'

          '<p><strong>What is the best region to grow broccoli? </strong>Because broccoli will prematurely flower if  allowed to get too warm, gardeners in cooler regions grow broccoli best in  spring and early summer. Gardeners in warmer regions can grow broccoli mid-fall  through winter.<br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Why does my broccoli have yellow flowers and no broccoli?</strong> If you see flowers, your broccoli has prematurely  flowered because of warm weather, OR your broccoli is over mature.<br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Why won&rsquo;t my Romenesco broccoli form a head?</strong> Broccoli &lsquo;Romanesco&rsquo; is really a green  cauliflower. Like cauliflower, it is very sensitive to an inconsistent growing  environment (fluctuations in weather, temperature and water). Gardeners in  regions that have very even growing conditions can grow this variety best, as  do greenhouse or hoophouse growers. This is also a very long season plant and it  does not form heads until late in the season. It may not be mature enough yet.<br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>When should I sow broccoli in the fall?</strong> If temperatures are over 85 degrees F in  your area in August, start planting indoors in the beginning of August. If  temperatures are consistently under 85 degrees in August, direct sown at the  end of July.<br>\n  <br>\n<strong>My broccoli won&rsquo;t form a head (blunting) or has formed a  tiny head (buttoning). Why?</strong> The  early development of a broccoli plant often affects head development; potted  plants that were root bound before being planted out or transplants that  experienced unusually cold temperatures after being planted out may blunt or  button. Both experiences are considered transplant shock.</p>'

If temperatures are consistently  under 85 degrees in August, direct sow at the end of July.<br>\n  <br>\n<strong>Can I grow brokali in  containers?</strong> The plants grow fairly large, about 3 feet tall, and so are not  recommended for containers other than raised beds. \u00a0</p>\n<p><br>\n  <strong>What parts of the  plant can I eat?</strong> Stems, florets and leaves are all delicious. Use the  florets and tender stems as you would broccoli and the leaves as you would  kale.

          '<p><strong><em>Common Disease Problems</em></strong><br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Bacterial Leaf Spot: </strong>This  causes brown water soaked spots on the foliage which eventually makes the  foliage turn yellow. It thrives in cooler temperatures. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Remove  infected plants. Rotate crops with plants in a different family. Avoid overhead  watering. Do not work around plants when they are wet. </em></strong><br>\n  <br>\n<strong>Clubroot: </strong>This  causes plants to wilt in patches during the day, stunts their growth, and  causes swollen or disfigured roots.\u00a0 <strong><em>Burpee  Recommends: Rotate crops with plants in a different family. Avoid overhead  watering. Provide adequate air circulation, do not overcrowd plants. Improve  drainage by reducing soil compaction. Do not work around plants when they are  wet. Control weeds where the disease can overwinter.<br>\n</em></strong><br>\n  <strong>Damping Off: </strong>This  is one of the most common problems when starting plants from seed. The seedling  emerges and appears healthy; then it suddenly wilts and dies for no obvious  reason. Damping off is caused by a fungus that is active when there is abundant  moisture and soils and air temperatures are above 68 degrees F. Typically, this  indicates that the soil is too wet or contains high amounts of nitrogen  fertilizer. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Keep seedlings moist but do not overwater; avoid  over-fertilizing your seedlings; thin out seedlings to avoid overcrowding; make  sure the plants are getting good air circulation; if you plant in containers,  thoroughly wash them in soapy water &amp; rinse in a ten per cent bleach  solution after use.</em></strong><br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Downy Mildew: </strong>This  fungus causes whitish gray patches on the undersides and eventually both sides  of the leaves. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Rotate crops with plants in a different family.  Avoid overhead watering. Provide adequate air circulation, do not overcrowd  plants. Do not work around plants when they are wet. </em></strong><br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Powdery Mildew: </strong>This fungus disease occurs on the top of the leaves in humid weather  conditions. The leaves appear to have a whitish or greyish surface and may  curl.<strong> <em>Burpee Recommends: Avoid powdery mildew by providing good air circulation  for the plants by good spacing and pruning. Contact your Cooperative Extension  Service for fungicide recommendations. </em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Common Pest and  Cultural Problems</em></strong><br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Aphids: </strong>Greenish, red, black or peach colored sucking  insects can spread disease as they feed on the undersides of leaves. They leave  a sticky residue on foliage that attracts ants. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends:  Introduce or attract natural predators into your garden such as lady beetles  and wasps which feed on aphids. You can also wash them off with a strong spray,  or use an insecticidal soap.<br>\n  </em></strong><br>\n  <strong>Cabbage Looper: </strong>These worms are  green with a white stripe on either side, about 1-1.5 inches long. They tunnel  through the heads. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Hand pick. Floating row covers can  help prevent their laying eggs on the plants. </em></strong><br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Flea Beetles: </strong>These  small hopping beetles feed on plant foliage and can spread disease. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Rotate crops with plants  in a different plant family. Use floating row covers to prevent damage to young  foliage.</em></strong> <br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Leafminers: </strong>These insects bore  just under the leaf surface causing irregular serpentine lines. The larvae are  yellow cylindrical maggots and the adults are small black and yellow flies.  They do not usually kill plants, but disfigure the foliage.<strong> <em>Burpee  Recommends: Remove affected foliage. </em></strong><br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Slugs: </strong>These  pests leave large holes in the foliage or eat leaves entirely. They leave a  slime trail, feed at night and are mostly a problem in damp weather.<strong> <em>Burpee  Recommends: Hand pick, at night if possible. You can try attracting the slugs  to traps either using cornmeal or beer. For a beer trap, dig a hole in the  ground and place a large cup or bowl into the hole; use something that has  steep sides so that the slugs can&rsquo;t crawl back out when they&rsquo;re finished. Fill  the bowl about \u00be of the way full with beer, and let it sit overnight. In the  morning, the bowl should be full of drowned slugs that can be dumped out for  the birds to eat. For a cornmeal trap, put a tablespoon or two of cornmeal in a  jar and put it on its side near the plants. Slugs are attracted to the scent  but they cannot digest it and it will kill them. You can also try placing a  barrier around your plants of diatomaceous earth or even coffee grounds. They  cannot crawl over these.</em></strong></p>'

          '<p><strong><em>Common Disease Problems</em></strong><br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Alternaria Leaf Spot: </strong>Small, round reddish brown spots, usually with a yellow halo, form on the  upper surface of the leaves. Severely infected leaves turn brown, curl upward,  wither and die. Fruit are not usually infected but can suffer from sunscald due  to leaf loss. This disease is worse in warm, wet or very humid weather.<strong> <em>Burpee  Recommends: Avoid getting water on the foliage. Remove infected plant parts and  do not work around wet plants. Provide plenty of air circulation. Contact your  Cooperative Extension Service for fungicide recommendations.</em></strong><br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Anthracnose:</strong> This is a fungus disease that attacks  the fruit as it is ripening. Irregular brown spots develop on the leaves.  Infected fruit develop sunken black spots that may have white mycelia during  wet weather. The spots enlarge and turn black; the fruit rots. Extended periods  of heat and humidity facilitate anthracnose growth. The fungus overwinters in  diseased plant debris. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Provide sufficient space  between plants for good air circulation, avoid overhead watering which can  spread the fungus spores, keep a clean garden, remove and discard all diseased  plant material and rotate crops.</em></strong><br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Bacterial Wilt:</strong> Leaves turn brown, stems wilt and shrivel, the infected plants die. <strong><em>Burpee  Recommends: Remove and destroy plants showing signs of the disease. Control  cucumber beetles, which spread the disease. Contact your Cooperative Extension  Service for recommendations. </em></strong><br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Powdery Mildew: </strong>This fungus disease occurs on the top of the leaves in humid weather  conditions. The leaves appear to have a whitish or greyish surface and may  curl.<strong> <em>Burpee Recommends: Avoid powdery mildew by providing good air  circulation for the plants by good spacing and pruning. Contact your  Cooperative Extension Service for fungicide recommendations. </em></strong><br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Seed Rot and Damping  Off: </strong>This is a fungus disease that affects seeds and seedlings. Infected  seeds will not spout. Infected seedlings can have brown thin stems and the  plants will quickly die. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Do not sow seeds until  the soil has warmed to 65 degrees. Plant seeds in a raised hill that will warm  up earlier. Keep beds moist but not water logged. </em></strong><br>\n</p>\n<p><strong><em>Common Pest and  Cultural Problems</em></strong><br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Aphids: </strong>Greenish, red, black or peach colored sucking  insects can spread disease as they feed on the undersides of leaves. They leave  a sticky residue on foliage that attracts ants. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends:  Introduce or attract natural predators into your garden such as lady beetles  and wasps which feed on aphids. You can also wash them off with a strong spray,  or use an insecticidal soap. </em></strong><br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Cucumber Beetles: </strong>Beetles<strong> </strong>may be spotted, striped or banded and can be very harmful.  Beetles are usually \u00bc to \u00bd inch in size. Beetles start feeding as soon as they  hatch and can kill or slow the growth of the plants. Beetle larva can also bore  through the roots of the plants. Beetles can also transmit diseases from plant  to plant. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Knock off  adults into a jar of soapy water and destroy them. Spade the soil to destroy  dormant beetles before you plant. Use a row cover to prevent adults from  feeding on young plants. Consult your  Cooperative Extension Service for insecticide recommendations. </em></strong><br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Fruit Splitting: </strong>This indicates that when the fruit was forming it did not get an even  supply of moisture from the roots. A sudden rush of water from sudden and heavy  summer rains through the stem can pop the skin of a ripening fruit like an  overfilled water balloon. The condition is particularly pronounced after a  drought when a summer storm delivers a great amount of water to the tissues in  the fruit. The skin cannot expand fast enough and splitting appears. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Take care with your  watering: instead of a quick sprinkle every day, water deeply once or twice a  week (depending on rainfall) so the moisture soaks deeply into the soil where  roots can take it up as needed. Soaker hoses can help. Stick your finger into  the soil every day to check that it is evenly moist a couple of inches below  the surface. </em></strong><br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Squash Bugs:</strong> Adults are 5/8 inch long and gray or  brown. Squash bugs give off a foul odor when crushed. Young nymphs have light  green abdomens and black heads and legs. As the nymphs grow they will change  color. Eggs are found in groups on the underside of leaves, eggs will be yellow  or brown. Squash bugs will feed on leaves and fruit.<strong><em> Burpee Recommends: Knock adults off into a jar of soapy water and  destroy them. Check for clusters of eggs on the back of leaves and destroy  them. Use a floating row cover to prevent females from laying eggs on plants.</em></strong><br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Spider Mites: </strong>These tiny spider-like pests are about  the size of a grain of pepper. They may be red, black, brown or yellow. They  suck on the plant juices removing chlorophyll and injecting toxins which cause  white dots on the foliage. There is often webbing visible on the plant. They  cause the foliage to turn yellow and become dry and stippled. They multiply  quickly and thrive in dry conditions. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Spider mites may  be controlled with a forceful spray every other day. Try hot pepper wax or  insecticidal soap. Check with your Cooperative Extension Service for miticide  recommendations. </em></strong><br>\n</p>'

          'FAQs',
          '<p><strong>Why does my fruit have  a bitter or poor flavor? </strong>Bitter flavor can be caused by a number of factors  including: hot and dry temperatures, overwatering, or poor soil fertilization.  Melons have shallow roots; make sure the soil is moist but never waterlogged.  Test your soil for nutrient deficiency.<br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Why do I have lots of leaves but no flowers? </strong>The  plant is likely getting too much nitrogen, which triggers it to grow foliage,  and not enough phosphorus, which favors flowering and fruiting. Choose a  fertilizer that has a balanced ratio of the three major elements, such as  10-10-10, or where the middle number (phosphorus) is larger than the first  number (nitrogen) such as 2-3-1. <br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Why do I have flowers but no fruit? </strong>\u00a0Cantaloupes  are &ldquo;Dioecious&rdquo;, meaning that they have both male and female flowers on the  same plant. Male flowers usually open first and female flowers have a baby  fruit behind the flower. Both<br>\ntypes of flowers must be present  to have fruit set.<strong> </strong>Flowers may abort because of heat or cold or  drought stress OR flowers abort because of a lack of pollination OR the plant  is not ready to set fruit and the plant is self-aborting flowers to conserve  and direct energy towards more growth.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>How  many melons per plant should I expect? </strong>Limit your fruit to 3-4 per plant. The more fruit  a vine supports, the smaller the fruit will be and the longer it will take to  ripen.<strong></strong><br>\n<br>\n<strong>Can  I ripen fruit off the vine? </strong>Regrettably,  no.\u00a0 Fruits are as ripe as they will ever  be the moment they are picked.\u00a0 <strong> </strong></p>'

          '<p><strong>Why do I have carrot tops but no carrots? </strong>Carrots are a long season crop, they take a  lot of time to grow their tap roots. If the greens of the carrot were cut  during the growing season, energy is misdirected back into foliar growth  instead of root growth. Protect your carrot greens. Poor soil will also inhibit  root growth, as well as a phosphorus or potassium deficiency.<br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Why aren&rsquo;t my carrots sweet? </strong>Carrots grown and harvested in warm weather are not as sweet as carrots  grown in warm weather and harvested in cool weather.

          '<p><strong>Why isn&rsquo;t my  cauliflower plant making any cauliflower? </strong>Cauliflower is very sensitive to an  inconsistent growing environment (fluctuations in weather, temperature, and  water). Too cold early in the plant&rsquo;s development and it may &ldquo;button&rdquo; (make a  very small head). Old or stressed plants may also button. Cauliflower  transplants that are root bound before being planted may button or not form a head  at all (this is called &ldquo;blunting&rdquo;). Gardeners in regions that have very even  growing conditions grow cauliflower best, as do greenhouse and hoop-house  growers.<strong></strong><br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Why are the curds  brown, green, yellow or off-colored? </strong>Curds are old or over exposed to the sun  or other environmental conditions. This is a problem of a non-self-branching  cauliflower when the leaves are not gathered and tied. Off-colored cauliflower  is still edible. Some varieties have different colored curds.<br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Is cauliflower as  easy to grow as broccoli?</strong> No, broccoli is easier to grow because it is not  as sensitive to consistent growing conditions. <br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>My cauliflower  produced a beautiful head! Will it produce any more?</strong> No it will only  produce one head. You can eat the foliage as other greens if you want to make  the most of it!<br>\n  <br>\n<strong>Why are the bottom  leaves turning yellow?</strong> Your plants may need to be fertilized. We recommend  Garden-tone every few weeks during the growing season. </p>'

It thrives in cooler temperatures. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Remove  infected plants. Rotate crops with plants in a different family. Avoid overhead  watering. Do not work around plants when they are wet. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Celery Mosaic Virus: </strong>This  causes yellowing of foliage, mosaic and or mottling pattern on leaves. Veins  become clear, leaves curled and crinkled or otherwise distorted. <strong><em>Burpee  Recommends: Rotate crops with plants in a different family. Eliminate weed  hosts like wild celery and wild parsnip.</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Early Blight: </strong>Small  yellow spots appear on both sides of the leaves. Later they become gray,  circular lesions. Spots dry out and crack and grey fuzzy growth occurs. <strong><em>Burpee  Recommends: Do not transplant infected plants. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Fusarium Wilt: </strong>This  fungal disease causes yellowing and stunting of older plants and yellowing,  stunting and death to seedlings. The plant will exhibit signs of wilting  frequently and the lower leaves turn yellow and dry up. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Plant  resistant varieties. Rotate crops. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Pink Rot: </strong>The  first symptom of pink rot is that brown lesions appear on the petioles. Lesions  rapidly expand into soft, watery, areas of decay. Plant tissue can turn pink  around the lesions. Profuse white mycelia are present in severe cases. Plant  base can collapse. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends:  Maintain adequate air movement. Do not water overhead.</em></strong><br>\n  <br>\n  <strong><em>Common Pest and  Cultural Problems</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Aphids: </strong>Greenish, red, black or peach colored sucking  insects can spread disease as they feed on the undersides of leaves. They leave  a sticky residue on foliage that attracts ants. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends:  Introduce or attract natural predators into your garden such as lady beetles  and wasps which feed on aphids. You can also wash them off with a strong spray,  or use an insecticidal soap. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Beet Army Worm: </strong>Nondescript brown  moths. Young worms feed on celery leaves. Larvae may be found in the petioles. <strong><em>Burpee  Recommends: Introduce natural enemies such as parasitic wasps. Remove  surrounding weed, as eggs are often found on them.</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Cabbage Looper: </strong>These worms are  green with a white stripe on either side, about 1-1.5 inches long. <strong><em>Burpee  Recommends: Hand pick. Floating row covers can help prevent their laying eggs  on the plants. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Leafminers: </strong>These insects bore  just under the leaf surface causing irregular serpentine lines. The larvae are  yellow cylindrical maggots and the adults are small black and yellow flies.  They do not usually kill plants, but disfigure the foliage.<strong> <em>Burpee  Recommends: Remove affected foliage. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Root Knot Nematodes: </strong>Microscopic worm-like pests that cause swellings (galls) to form on  roots. Plants may wilt or appear stunted. This is a serious problem in many  Southern states. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Do  not plant into infested soil. Grow resistant varieties.

This must  be done to turn the inner stems pale and to keep the plants from sprawling.<br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Can the root be left  in the ground and grow again next year?</strong> Roots left in the ground will not  produce anything harvestable the following year, although the plant is a  biennial and may sprout from the roots. <br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Why does my celery  taste bitter?</strong> Celery may become bitter from lack of water or high  temperatures. Celery prefers cool and constantly moist growing conditions. <br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Why are my celery  stalks tubular?</strong> This can occur when the plants experience a lack of water  or nutrients.

You should have a minimum 10 foot by 10 foot  area. The exception to this rule is &lsquo;On Deck&rsquo; corn, which has been bred to grow  in containers. If you are growing &lsquo;On Deck&rsquo;, choose a container that is at  least 24 inches wide and deep and plant nine seeds evenly spaced. </li>\n  <li>Isolate corn varieties when recommended (Sh2s),  by planting corn seeds at least 250 feet apart, or select varieties that mature  at least 2 weeks apart so they will not cross pollinate. </li>\n  <li>When choosing a site for corn, plant on the  north side of your garden so the tall plants do not shade other plants in your  vegetable garden.</li>\n  <li>Corn is a warm season crop and should not be  planted in cool soils. The non Sh2 varieties tend to be more tolerant of cool  soils, but in general the soil should be about 65 degrees F or warmer. </li>\n  <li>Sow corn seed 1 inch deep, 5 to 6 inches apart  in rows 2 to 3 feet apart. </li>\n  <li>Seedlings emerge in 7-14 days.</li>\n  <li>When corn seedlings are 3-5 inches tall and  healthy, thin to 1 foot apart. </li>\n</ul>'

          '<ul>\n  <li>Keep  weeds under control during the growing season. Weeds compete with plants for  water, space and nutrients, so control them by either cultivating often or use  a mulch to prevent their seeds from germinating. </li>\n  <li>Keep  plants well watered during dry periods to promote uninterrupted growth. Corn  needs 1-2 inches of rain per week for best production. Use a rain gauge to  check to see if you need to add water. Corn is also a heavy feeder and will  benefit from side dressings of fertilizer applied as directed through the  growing season. </li>\n  <li>Monitor  for pests and diseases. Check with your local Cooperative Extension Service for  pest controls recommended for your area. </li>\n  <li>Suckers  tend to form at the base of the plants; they help support the stalks and make  food for the plant. The stalks may have to be staked in windy areas, but in general  they are self-supporting.</li>\n  <li>Sunflowers  are good companion plant for corns. Direct sow sunflowers in rows parallel to  corn rows to help separate corn varieties that need isolation from each other.  Choose sunflower varieties of comparable height to the corn plantings. The  sunflower border, with vibrant hues in russets to golden-yellow, will add  sparkle next to the almost all-green corn plot.

          '<ul>\n  <li>Ears  of corn are ready to harvest about 17-20 days after the silks appear. The  kernels should be firm. Open an ear and pierce a kernel with your fingernail.  If the liquid is watery, the corn is not ripe yet. It should be milky. If it is  creamy, it is overripe and will not taste as sweet.</li>\n  <li>Firmly  grip the ear and twist downward to harvest. Take care not to break the plant  when harvesting the first ear, or the second ear will not develop. Most corn  produces two ears.</li>\n  <li>Store  unhusked corn in the fridge and consume as soon as possible.

          '<p><strong><em>Common Disease Problems</em></strong><br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Bacterial Wilt: </strong>This causes yellow streaking on the foliage. It is soil borne and spread  by flea beetles. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends:  Rotate crops and control flea beetles. Many hybrid corn varieties are  resistant. </em></strong><br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Corn Smut: </strong>This  fungus infests corn ears causing them to expand and turn black as they fill  with fungus spores. The ears become quite disfigured. The disease can also  affect the foliage. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends:  Remove and discard all infected plant parts as soon as you see the disease.  Rotate crops as the disease can overwinter in the soil. </em></strong><br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Damping Off: </strong>This  is one of the most common problems when starting plants from seed. The seedling  emerges and appears healthy; then it suddenly wilts and dies for no obvious  reason. Damping off is caused by a fungus that is active when there is abundant  moisture and soils and air temperatures are above 68 degrees F. Typically, this  indicates that the soil is too wet or contains high amounts of nitrogen  fertilizer. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Keep seedlings moist but do not overwater; avoid  over-fertilizing your seedlings; thin out seedlings to avoid overcrowding; make  sure the plants are getting good air circulation.</em></strong><br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Leaf Blights: </strong>This  causes tan spotting on the foliage and causes plants to lose vigor. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Rotate crops. Check with your Cooperative Extension  Service for fungicide recommendations. </em></strong><br>\n  <br>\n<strong>Rust:</strong> A  number of fungus diseases that rust colored spots on foliage, stalks and husks. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Plant early as  these diseases tend to be worse later in the season. Plant resistant varieties.  Practice crop rotation. Remove infected plants. </em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Common Pest and  Cultural Problems</em></strong><br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Corn Earworm: </strong>This  very destructive pest lays eggs on corn silks and the larvae tunnel into the  ears and feed on the kernels at the tip. <strong><em>Burpee  Recommends: Some varieties are tightly husked and tend to be resistant. You can  apply mineral oil to silks every 2-3 days to help prevent damage by the larvae.</em></strong><br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>European Corn Borer: </strong>This insect overwinters as a worm in corn stalk plant debris. They emerge  in spring as yellow/brown moths which lay their eggs on the undersides of corn  leaves. The larvae feed on pollen and plant tissue and bore into the stalks.  They can damage ears and damage stalks to the point of breaking. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Look for signs of boring  in the plant stalks, which will be holes. You can try to probe the stems and  kill the borer if possible. Rotate  crops and remove plant debris at the end of the season. Check with your  Cooperative Extension Service for pesticide recommendations. </em></strong><br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Flea Beetles: </strong>These  small hopping beetles feed on plant foliage and spread diseases. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Rotate crops with plants  in a different plant family. Use floating row covers to prevent damage to young  foliage.</em></strong> <br>\n  <br>\n<strong>Japanese Beetles</strong>: <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Hand pick  early in the morning into a bucket of soapy water.</em></strong></p>\n<strong>Raccoons and other Mammals: </strong>Raccoons, ground hogs  and deer, as well as birds can be a problem. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Ground hogs and raccoons may be trapped.

          '<p><strong>Does corn have to be  direct sown, can I start it indoors? </strong>We recommend direct sowing corn, not  starting it indoors. Transplanted corn is prone to stunting or exhibiting  deformed growth.<br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Why do I have spotty  germination on my Sh2 corn? </strong>The sweeter the corn, the warmer the soil must  be for sowing. Sh2 varieties require a warm soil, at least 65 degrees F, and  can rot in the soil if they are sown in cooler soils.<br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Why is my corn  leaning over? </strong>Corn grows buttress roots and suckers to stay upright:  shallow or undeveloped roots will cause the plants to lean over in rain or  wind. Use a balanced fertilizer to grow strong roots. Check for soil pests that  would stunt roots. Heavy rains and soil erosion can also undermine corn plants.<strong> </strong><br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Why don&rsquo;t my ears of  corn have kernels? </strong>Every individual silk makes a corn kernel. Incomplete  pollination of every silk will cause spotty kernel formation. Corn plants  require even, consistent moisture. Plants need cross pollination to develop  full ears. If corn is stressed by high temperatures or too little water it can  tassel early and the pollen can die on the tassels before the silks are  produced.<br>\n  <br>\n<strong>Why did my On Deck corn not produce ears? </strong>There are a number of possible reasons for  this, including too cool or too warm temperatures, too little or too much  fertilizer, too little water or not enough sun. A very common cause of this is  that the container is too small or the plants are overcrowded. In our trials we  have found that the smallest container that will produce good quality corn is  24 inches in diameter and depth, with nine plants. Smaller containers or too  many plants will cause nutrient deficiencies and water stress because of the  restricted space. </p>'

          '<p><strong>What are inoculants?</strong> Inoculants are dormant bacteria safe to use with beans. Cowpeas, like other  beans and peas, form a beneficial relationship with these bacteria commonly  found in soil to capture nitrogen. Inoculants help beans planted in less than  optimally warm or poor soils. New or heavily disturbed soils and soilless mixes  need inoculants as they do not have a natural supply in the soil already.<br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Are your seed treated  with inoculants or fungicides? </strong>We do not treat our seed with any products  after harvest.<strong></strong><br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Why do I have no  flowers on my plants?</strong> Too much fertilizer will make lots of leaves and no flowers.  In the South, a pest called the Tarnished Plant Bug may inject a toxin into the  plant that stops flower and pod production.<br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Why do my plants have  flowers but no pods?</strong> Heat, moisture, and a nutrient deficiency (usually  phosphorus and calcium) or too much nitrogen can cause flowers to abort.<br>\n  <br>\n<strong>Can I start my cowpea  plants indoors? </strong>We do not recommend starting cowpeas or any beans indoors.  The plants roots are easily damaged when transplanting, and beans grow so  quickly they do not need to be started early.</p>'

          '<p><strong><em>Common Disease Problems</em></strong><br>\n  <br>\n<strong>Alternaria  Leaf Spot: </strong>Small, round reddish  brown spots, usually with a yellow halo, form on the upper surface of the  leaves. Severely infected leaves turn brown, curl upward, wither and die. Fruit  are not usually infected but can suffer from sunscald due to leaf loss. This  disease is worse in warm, wet or very humid weather.<strong> <em>Burpee Recommends:  Avoid getting water on the foliage. Remove infected plant parts and do not work  around wet plants. Provide plenty of air circulation. Contact your Cooperative  Extension Service for fungicide recommendations.</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Anthracnose:</strong> This is a fungus disease that attacks the fruit as it is ripening. Irregular  brown spots develop on the leaves. Infected fruit develop sunken black spots  that may have white mycelia during wet weather. The spots enlarge and turn  black; the fruit rots. Extended periods of heat and humidity facilitate  anthracnose growth. The fungus overwinters in diseased plant debris. <strong><em>Burpee  Recommends: Provide sufficient space between plants for good air circulation,  avoid overhead watering which can spread the fungus spores, keep a clean  garden, remove and discard all diseased plant material and rotate crops.</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Bacterial Wilt:</strong> Leaves turn brown,  stems wilt and shrivel, the infected plants die. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends:  Remove and destroy plants showing signs of the disease. Control cucumber  beetles, which spread the disease. Contact your Cooperative Extension Service  for recommendations. </em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Powdery Mildew: </strong>This fungus disease occurs on the  top of the leaves in humid weather conditions. The leaves appear to have a  whitish or greyish surface and may curl.<strong> <em>Burpee Recommends: Avoid powdery  mildew by providing good air circulation for the plants by good spacing and  pruning. Contact your Cooperative Extension Service for fungicide  recommendations. </em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Seed Rot and Damping Off: </strong>This is a  fungus disease that affects seeds and seedlings. Infected seeds will not spout.  Infected seedlings can have brown thin stems and the plants will quickly die. <strong><em>Burpee  Recommends: Do not sow seeds until the soil has warmed to 65 degrees. Plant  seeds in a raised hill that will warm up earlier. Keep beds moist but not water  logged. </em></strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong><strong><em>Common Pest and Cultural Problems</em></strong><br>\n  <br>\n<strong>Aphids: </strong>Greenish,  red, black or peach colored sucking insects can spread disease as they feed on  the undersides of leaves.

Beetles are usually \u00bc to \u00bd inch in  size. Beetles start feeding as soon as they hatch and can kill or slow the  growth of the plants. Beetle larva can also bore through the roots of the  plants. Beetles can also transmit diseases from plant to plant. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Knock off adults into a  jar of soapy water and destroy them. Spade the soil to destroy dormant beetles  before you plant. Use a row cover to prevent adults from feeding on young  plants. Consult your Cooperative  Extension Service for other insecticide recommendations. </em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Squash  Bugs:</strong> Adults are 5/8 inch long and gray or brown. Squash bugs give off a  foul odor when crushed. Young nymphs have light green abdomens and black heads  and legs. As the nymphs grow they will change color. Eggs are found in groups  on the underside of leaves eggs will be yellow or brown. Squash bugs will feed  on leaves and fruit.<strong><em> Burpee  Recommends:\u00a0 Brush off adults into a jar  of soapy water and destroy them. Check for clusters of eggs on the back of  leaves and destroy them. Use a floating row cover to prevent females from  laying eggs on plants.</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Spider  mites: </strong>These tiny spider-like pests are about the size of a grain of  pepper. They may be red, black, brown or yellow. They suck on the plant juices  removing chlorophyll and injecting toxins which cause white dots on the  foliage. There is often webbing visible on the plant. They cause the foliage to  turn yellow and become dry and stippled. They multiply quickly and thrive in  dry conditions. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Spider mites may be controlled with a  forceful spray every other day. Try hot pepper wax or insecticidal soap. Check  with your Cooperative Extension Service for miticide recommendations. </em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Misshapen Fruit: </strong>Cucumbers can  become round or misshapen when they receive too much water.

          'FAQs',
          '<p><strong>Why does my fruit  have a bitter or poor flavor? </strong>Bitter flavor can be caused by a number of  factors including: hot and dry temperatures, overwatering, or poor soil  fertilizer. Cucumbers have shallow roots; make sure the soil is moist but never  waterlogged. Test your soil for a nutrient deficiency.<br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Why do I have lots of leaves but no flowers? </strong>The  plant is likely getting too much nitrogen, which triggers it to grow foliage,  and not enough phosphorus, which favors flowering and fruiting. Choose a  fertilizer that has a balanced ratio of the three major elements, such as  10-10-10, or where the middle number (phosphorus) is larger than the first  number (nitrogen) such as 2-3-1. <br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Why do I have flowers but no fruit? </strong>\u00a0Cucumbers  are &ldquo;Dioecious&rdquo;, meaning that they have both male and female flowers on the  same plant. Male flowers usually open first and female flowers have a baby  fruit behind the flower. Both types of flowers must be present to have fruit  set.<strong> </strong>Flowers may abort because of heat or cold or drought stress  OR flowers abort because of a lack of pollination OR the plant is not ready to  set fruit and the plant is self-aborting flowers to conserve and direct energy  towards more growth.<br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Why did my green cucumbers turn yellow? The fruit has over matured and  must be removed. An over ripen fruit is usually bitter. Pick fruits as soon as  it is the right size to use.</strong><br>\n  <br>\n<strong>Why are my cucumbers  curved? </strong>Incomplete pollination of the female flower will cause deformed,  curved growth, as can drought stress and being grown on the ground. Training plants  on a trellis is the best way to ensure long, straight cucumbers.</p>'

          '<p><strong><em>Common Disease Problems</em></strong><br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Anthracnose: </strong>Small  circular or irregular shaped dry spots are gray to tan in color and can cause  dead tissue. \u00a0<strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Rotate crops  with plants in a different family. Avoid overhead watering. Provide adequate  air circulation, do not overcrowd plants. Improve drainage by reducing soil  compaction. Do not work around plants when they are wet. Control weeds where  the disease can overwinter.</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Bacterial Leaf Spot: </strong>This  causes brown water soaked spots on the foliage which eventually makes the  foliage turn yellow. It thrives in cooler temperatures. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Remove  infected plants. Rotate crops with plants in a different family. Avoid overhead  watering. Do not work around plants when they are wet. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Bottom Rot</strong><strong>: </strong>Small  red to brown spots form on the undersides of lower leaves which causes leaves  to rot quickly, causing the head of the plant to become slimy. <strong><em>Burpee  Recommends: Avoid getting water on the foliage. Remove infected plant parts and  do not work around wet plants. Provide plenty of air circulation. Contact your  Cooperative Extension Service for fungicide recommendations.</em></strong><strong></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Damping Off: </strong>This  is one of the most common problems when starting plants from seed. The seedling  emerges and appears healthy; then it suddenly wilts and dies for no obvious  reason. Damping off is caused by a fungus that is active when there is abundant  moisture and soils and air temperatures are above 68 degrees F. Typically, this  indicates that the soil is too wet or contains high amounts of nitrogen  fertilizer. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Keep seedlings moist but do not overwater; avoid  over-fertilizing your seedlings; thin out seedlings to avoid overcrowding; make  sure the plants are getting good air circulation; if you plant in containers,  thoroughly wash them in soapy water &amp; rinse in a ten per cent bleach  solution after use.</em></strong><br>\n<strong><br>\nDowny Mildew: </strong>This  fungus causes whitish gray patches on the undersides and eventually both sides  of the leaves. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Rotate crops with plants in a different family.  Avoid overhead watering. Provide adequate air circulation, do not overcrowd  plants. Do not work around plants when they are wet. </em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Common Pest and  Cultural Problems</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Aphids: </strong>Greenish, red, black or peach colored sucking  insects can spread disease as they feed on the undersides of leaves. They leave  a sticky residue on foliage that attracts ants. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends:  Introduce or attract natural predators into your garden such as lady beetles  and wasps which feed on aphids. You can also wash them off with a strong spray,  or use an insecticidal soap. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Cabbage Looper: </strong>These worms are  green with a white stripe on either side, about 1-1.5 inches long. They tunnel  through the heads. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Hand pick. Floating row covers can  help prevent their laying eggs on the plants. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Flea Beetles: </strong>These  small hopping beetles feed on plant foliage and can spread disease. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Rotate crops with plants  in a different plant family. Use floating row covers to prevent damage to young  foliage.</em></strong> <br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Leafminers: </strong>These insects bore  just under the leaf surface causing irregular serpentine lines. The larvae are  yellow cylindrical maggots and the adults are small black and yellow flies.  They do not usually kill plants, but disfigure the foliage.<strong> <em>Burpee  Recommends: Remove affected foliage. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Slugs: </strong>These  pests leave large holes in the foliage or eat leaves entirely. They leave a  slime trail, feed at night and are mostly a problem in damp weather.<strong> <em>Burpee  Recommends: Hand pick, at night if possible. You can try attracting the slugs  to traps either using cornmeal or beer. For a beer trap, dig a hole in the  ground and place a large cup or bowl into the hole; use something that has  steep sides so that the slugs can&rsquo;t crawl back out when they&rsquo;re finished. Fill  the bowl about \u00be of the way full with beer, and let it sit overnight. In the  morning, the bowl should be full of drowned slugs that can be dumped out for  the birds to eat. For a cornmeal trap, put a tablespoon or two of cornmeal in a  jar and put it on its side near the plants. Slugs are attracted to the scent  but they cannot digest it and it will kill them. You can also try placing a barrier  around your plants of diatomaceous earth or even coffee grounds. They cannot  crawl over these.</em></strong></p>'

          '<p><strong><em>Common Disease Problems</em></strong><br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Blue Mold: </strong>Bruising  or mechanical injury can cause a blue mold to form on the injured part of the  bulb. This is harmless to the bulb. <strong><em>Burpee  Recommends: Carefully washed off the bulb prior to planting. Dust with a  fungicide recommended by your Cooperative Extension Service. </em></strong><br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Botrytis: </strong>This  fungus causes a grey mold in the necks and bulbs. It thrives in cool wet  weather conditions.<strong> <em>Burpee Recommends: Remove affected plant parts, avoid  watering at night and getting water on the plant when watering.

Infected plants  show signs of nutrient deficiencies and drought because the roots cannot take  up water and nutrients. Plants are stunted. The disease lives in the soil for  several years and thrives in warm temperatures. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Plant as early as possible so the bulb of the plant  growth will be I cooler temperatures. Rotate crops and plant resistant  varieties. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Rust:</strong> A  number of fungus diseases that rust colored spots on foliage, stalks and husks. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Plant resistant  varieties. Practice crop rotation. Contact your Cooperative Extension Service  for recommendations. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><em><br>\n  Common Pest and  Cultural Problems</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Bulb Mites: </strong>Shiny, creamy  white, bulbous-appearing mites. They penetrate the outer layer of the tissue  creating openings for rotting organisms. They are most damaging during cool,  wet weather when plant growth is slowed down. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Crop  rotation. Clean bulbs before planting.</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Bulb Nematodes: </strong>Microscopic worm-like pests that live and reproduce inside the garlic  bulb, feeding on the stems, leaves and bulbs. It can live for several years in  the soil. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: You can  have your soil tested by your local Cooperative Extension Service to see if you  have nematodes. Do not plant into infested soil and do not plant related crops  into the soil for several years. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Leafminers: </strong>These insects bore  just under the leaf surface causing irregular serpentine lines.

          "<p><strong><em>Common Disease Problems</em></strong><br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Alternaria Leaf Spot: </strong>Small, round reddish brown spots with white to gray centers form on the  upper surface of the leaves and along the midrib. The lesions may encircle the  stems and cause wilt. This disease is worse in warm, wet or very humid weather.<strong> <em>Burpee Recommends: Avoid getting water on the foliage. Remove infected plant  parts and do not work around wet plants. Provide plenty of air circulation.  Contact your Cooperative Extension Service for fungicide recommendations.</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Anthracnose:</strong> This is a fungus disease that attacks  the fruit as it is ripening. The first visible sign is a circular spot on the  skin that is slightly sunken. The spots enlarge and turn black; the fruit rots.  Extended periods of heat and humidity facilitate anthracnose growth. The fungus  overwinters in diseased plant debris. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Plant resistant  varieties, provide sufficient space between plants for good air circulation,  avoid overhead watering which can spread the fungus spores, keep a clean  garden, remove and discard all diseased plant material and rotate crops. Use a  mulch to prevent spores from splashing from the soil onto plants.</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Bacterial Leaf Spot: </strong>First signs are small translucent spots with a broad yellowish edge that  slowly enlarge and become angular or irregularly circular with a reddish  center. It thrives in cooler temperatures.<strong> </strong><strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Remove  infected plants. Rotate crops with plants in a different family. Avoid overhead  watering. Do not work around plants when they are wet</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Downy Mildew: </strong>This  fungus causes whitish gray patches on the undersides and eventually both sides  of the leaves. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Rotate crops with plants in a different family.  Avoid overhead watering. Provide adequate air circulation, do not overcrowd  plants. Do not work around plants when they are wet. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Powdery Mildew: </strong>This fungus disease occurs on the top of the leaves in humid weather  conditions. The leaves appear to have a whitish or greyish surface and may  curl.<strong> <em>Burpee Recommends: Avoid powdery mildew by providing good air  circulation for the plants by good spacing and pruning. Contact your  Cooperative Extension Service for fungicide recommendations. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><em><br>\n  Common Pest and  Cultural Problems</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Aphids: </strong>Greenish, red, black or peach colored sucking  insects can spread disease as they feed on the undersides of leaves. They leave  a sticky residue on foliage that attracts ants. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends:  Introduce or attract natural predators into your garden such as lady beetles  and wasps who feed on aphids. You can also wash them off with a strong spray,  or use an insecticidal soap. </em></strong><br>\n<strong><br>\nBlossom End Rot (BER): </strong>Blossom End Rot causes large brown or black dry or sunken spot(s) to  appear, usually starting at blossom end (opposite the stem) of the fruit.  Fruits often ripen prematurely. BER occurs when a plant cannot metabolize the  calcium it needs to develop properly. This can occur when there is not enough  calcium in the soil or when root damage and water stress reduce the uptake and  movement of calcium through a plant. Occasionally, BER is the result of  excessive nitrogen fertilization. It only takes a day for a lack of calcium to  affect fruit, and that day can occur any time after blossom set. </p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Once a  fruit has BER it will not recover. The plant is still healthy, just remove the  affected fruit from the plant. The fruit is still good to eat if you remove the  affected part. </li>\n  <li>BER  most frequently occurs on fruit produced earlier and later in the season as  this is when natural fluctuations in precipitation and cold weather occur. \u00a0</li>\n  <li>To  avoid BER, properly site and prepare your garden bed before planting. Most  crops need full sun and loose, well-drained organic soil. Make sure soil pH is  slightly acidic, between 6.2 to 6.8, for optimum nutrient uptake. Test your  soil to see if calcium is recommended. If it is, apply lime in the recommended  quantity according to manufacturer's instructions.\u00a0 </li>\n  <li>Avoid  planting too early in cool soils as this can inhibit early root development,  making the plant more susceptible to BER. Start with a quality transplant: a  healthy seedling with strong roots will make a healthy plant. </li>\n  <li>Avoid  wide fluctuations in soil moisture by applying 2-3 inches of mulch. This will  moderate the release of water to plant roots, and also keep the soil from  drying out when it is directly exposed to the sun.\u00a0 </li>\n  <li>Avoid  drought stress by making sure your plants get at least 2 inches of rain or  water per week. Apply enough water to moisten more than the top inch of soil.  Container grown plants will need more than 2 inches of applied-water per week  in hot weather, check them daily if possible. Consider using drip irrigation or  soaker hoses. One or two soakings are better than many light waterings. </li>\n  <li>Avoid  over-fertilizing during the early fruiting stage, especially if the fertilizer  contains high percentages of nitrogen. Use fertilizers especially formulated  for tomatoes such as Tomato-tone. These fertilizers have just the right amount  of nitrogen and other micronutrients best for fruit production. </li>\n  <li>Avoid  close cultivation around the base of plants when weeding. A layer of mulch  should help prevent the possible disturbance or damage of fragile roots  accidentally.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Cucumber Beetles: </strong>Beetles<strong> </strong>may be spotted, striped or banded and can be very harmful.  Beetles are usually \u00bc to \u00bd inch in size. Beetles start feeding as soon as they  hatch and can kill or slow the growth of the plants. Beetle larva can also bore  through the roots of the plants. Beetles can also transmit diseases from plant  to plant. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Knock off  adults into a jar of soapy water and destroy them. Spade the soil to destroy  dormant beetles before you plant. Use a row cover to prevent adults from  feeding on young plants. Consult your  Cooperative Extension Service for other insecticide recommendations. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Spider Mites: </strong>These tiny spider-like pests are about  the size of a grain of pepper. They may be red, black, brown or yellow. They  suck on the plant juices removing chlorophyll and injecting toxins which cause  white dots on the foliage. There is often webbing visible on the plant. They  cause the foliage to turn yellow and become dry and stippled. They multiply  quickly and thrive in dry conditions. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Spider mites may  be controlled with a forceful spray every other day. Try hot pepper wax or  insecticidal soap. Check with your Cooperative Extension Service for miticide  recommendations. </em></strong></p>\n<strong>Squash Vine Borer: </strong>The brown headed larva  will bore into the stem, feed through the center of the stems, block the flow  of water and the plants will collapse and die. The first sign of this pest is  that the plant will wilt during the day and perk up at night. Check the base of  the plant for holes and you will see what looks like sawdust. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Pull and destroy and  plants killed by squash vine bores. Row covers will prevent the female from  laying her eggs. In most areas there is only one generation a year so a second  crop can be planted in early July. Although you can&rsquo;t always save the plant, as  soon as you see the wilting plant, using a sharp knife cut a slit in the stem  above the hole. Kill the borers with the tip of the knife or pull it out. Mound  soil over the cut area and keep soil most. New roots may grow and the plant may  live. Rotate crops. Consult your  Cooperative Extension Service for other insecticide recommendations.</em></strong>"

          '<p><strong>Do I have to cure the  fruit to make it last?</strong> Yes, curing it will help the skin to harden which  will help preserve the fruit for several months. Cure them in a warm, dry, well  ventilated location in the shade, such as a garage or shed for at least a week.<br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Do I need to support  my gourds?</strong> Yes, gourds grow on long vines that should be supports to keep  the fruit off the ground which could otherwise cause the fruit to rot.\u00a0 <br>\n  <strong><br>\n  How do I make a luffa  sponge?</strong> When growing luffa gourds to use as sponges, pinch off all but one  or two fruits per plant. Allow these to mature until the stem turns yellow and  the skin begins to dry and fade. The fruit should be 16-24 inches long. Cut the  gourds off the vine with scissors or a sharp knife and allow them to dry in the  sun for about two weeks. They are ready when the skin hardens and turns brown.  Cut open the larger end of the fruit and shake out the seeds. Soak for a day or  two in water. Peel off the outer skin. The sponges may be dingy yellow in  color. If you wish to lighten the color bleach the sponges in a 10% solution  for an hour or so. The softness of the sponge will be determined by the color  of the skin of the fruit when it is harvested. Greener fruit produce softer  sponges, yellower fruit produces tougher sponges. Harvest on the green side for  bathing sponges. <br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Are gourds edible?</strong> They are not poisonous, but they have been developed for the ornamental quality  of the fruit. There is not much flesh to eat, and the flesh that there is may  be bitter or tasteless. <br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Will  mixed gourds cross pollinate and produce strange fruit?</strong> Cross pollination will not be a problem unless  you are saving the seed.</p>'

          '<p><strong><em>Common Disease Problems</em></strong><br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Bacterial Leaf Spot: </strong>First signs are small translucent spots with a broad yellowish edge that  slowly enlarge and become angular or irregularly circular with a reddish  center. It thrives in cooler temperatures.<strong> </strong><strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Remove  infected plants and do not plant horseradish in the same area. Avoid overhead  watering. Do not work around plants when they are wet.</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Cercospora Leaf  Blight: </strong>Small flecks which develop a yellowish halo appear on the leaves  and turn brown and coalesce. They cause the leaves to wither and die. <strong><em>Burpee  Recommends: Remove infected plants and destroy all plant debris. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Root Rots: </strong>A  number of pathogens cause root rots. <strong><em>Burpee  Recommends: Practice crop rotation and do not plant related crops in the same  area for several years. Pull up and discard infected plants. Make sure your  soil has excellent drainage. Contact your Cooperative Extension Service for  recommendations. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Rust:</strong> A  number of fungus diseases that cause rust colored spots on foliage, stalks and  husks. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Plant  resistant varieties. Practice crop rotation. Remove infected plants. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Turnip Mosaic Virus:</strong> This causes ring spots and  mosaic or mottling on the leaves and black streaks on the leaf stalk. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: </em></strong><strong><em>Remove  infected plants and discard. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><em><br>\n  Common Pest and  Cultural Problems</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Aphids: </strong>Greenish, red, black or peach colored sucking  insects can spread disease as they feed on the undersides of leaves. They leave  a sticky residue on foliage that attracts ants. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends:  Introduce or attract natural predators into your garden such as lady beetles  and wasps which feed on aphids. You can also wash them off with a strong spray,  or use an insecticidal soap. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Cabbage Looper: </strong>These worms are  green with a white stripe on either side, about 1-1.5 inches long. <strong><em>Burpee  Recommends: Hand pick. Floating row covers can help prevent their laying eggs  on the plants. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Flea Beetles: </strong>These  small hopping beetles feed on plant foliage and may spread diseases. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Rotate crops with plants  in a different plant family. Use floating row covers to prevent damage to young  foliage.</em></strong> <br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Leafhoppers: </strong>Leafhoppers cause injury to leaves and  stunt growth. They also spread disease. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Remove plant  debris. Use insecticidal soaps. Consult your Cooperative Extension Service for  other insecticide recommendations. </em></strong><br>\n<strong><br>\nSlugs: </strong>These  pests leave large holes in the foliage or eat leaves entirely. They leave a  slime trail, feed at night and are mostly a problem in damp weather.<strong> <em>Burpee  Recommends: Hand pick, at night if possible. You can try attracting the slugs  to traps either using cornmeal or beer. For a beer trap, dig a hole in the  ground and place a large cup or bowl into the hole; use something that has  steep sides so that the slugs can&rsquo;t crawl back out when they&rsquo;re finished. Fill  the bowl about \u00be of the way full with beer, and let it sit overnight. In the  morning, the bowl should be full of drowned slugs that can be dumped out for  the birds to eat. For a cornmeal trap, put a tablespoon or two of cornmeal in a  jar and put it on its side near the plants. Slugs are attracted to the scent  but they cannot digest it and it will kill them. You can also try placing a  barrier around your plants of diatomaceous earth or even coffee grounds. They  cannot crawl over these.</em></strong></p>'

          'FAQs',
          '<p><strong>My roots arrived with  a mold on them, will they be OK to plant?</strong> Yes, this is most likely a  surface mold that will not affect the plants. It comes from the roots being in  transit several days in warm conditions without adequate air circulation. If  the roots are not mushy or do not have a foul odor, wash off the mold and  plant. <br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Can I grow  horseradish in zone 10?</strong> No, horseradish is only recommended to zone 9  because the plants require cool falls and winters for the best flavor. <br>\n  <strong><br>\n  How long before I can  harvest my horseradish?</strong> Do not harvest horseradish the first year as this  will weaken the plants. Wait until the end of the second year after planting to  harvest. <br>\n  <strong><br>\n  How do I get the  hottest horseradish?</strong> For the hottest horseradish, use the roots as soon as  possible after harvest, the heat fades the longer the roots are stored. Roots  should be creamy white when cut. The pungency also begins to wane when fresh  crushed horseradish is exposed to air. When making your own sauce, add vinegar  to stabilize the flavor about three minutes after grating. Add 2-3 tablespoons  of white distilled vinegar and \u00bd teaspoon of salt to each cup of grated root. <br>\n<strong><br>\nAre the leaves  edible?</strong> Yes, the fresh leaves may be used in salads. </p>'

          'Common Pests and Problems',
          '<p><strong><em>Common Disease Problems</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Damping Off: </strong>This  is one of the most common problems when starting plants from seed. The seedling  emerges and appears healthy; then it suddenly wilts and dies for no obvious  reason. Damping off is caused by a fungus that is active when there is abundant  moisture and soils and air temperatures are above 68 degrees F. Typically, this  indicates that the soil is too wet or contains high amounts of nitrogen  fertilizer. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Keep seedlings moist but do not overwater; avoid  over-fertilizing your seedlings; thin out seedlings to avoid overcrowding; make  sure the plants are getting good air circulation; if you plant in containers,  thoroughly wash them in soapy water and rinse in a ten per cent bleach solution  after use.</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Downy Mildew: </strong>This  fungus causes whitish gray patches on the undersides and eventually both sides  of the leaves. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Rotate crops with plants in a different family.  Avoid overhead watering. Provide adequate air circulation, do not overcrowd  plants. Do not work around plants when they are wet. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Onion White Rot: </strong>This  soil-borne fungus causes yellowing and wilting of foliage above ground. Below  ground, the roots rot and the fungus also infects the bulb. At the base of the  bulb, a white fluffy fungus will appear with black fungal bodies. <strong><em>Burpee  Recommends: Remove infected bulbs. Practice crop rotation with members of the  onion family. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Pink Root Rot: </strong>A fungus that attacks roots causing them to turn a light pink, then red  and eventually purple-brown and causing them to shrivel. Infected plants show  signs of nutrient deficiencies and drought because the roots cannot take up water  and nutrients. Plants are stunted. The disease lives in the soil for several  years and thrives in warm temperatures. <strong><em>Burpee  Recommends: Plant as early as possible so the bulk of the plant growth will be  in cooler temperatures. Rotate crops and plant resistant varieties. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Rust:</strong> A  number of fungus diseases that cause rust colored spots on foliage, stalks and  husks. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Plant early  as these diseases tend to be worse later in the season. Plant resistant  varieties. Practice crop rotation. Remove infected plants. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><em><br>\n  Common Pest and  Cultural Problems</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Leafminers: </strong>These insects bore  just under the leaf surface causing irregular serpentine lines. The larvae are  yellow cylindrical maggots and the adults are small black and yellow flies.  They do not usually kill plants, but disfigure the foliage.<strong> <em>Burpee  Recommends: Remove affected foliage. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Leek Moth: </strong>These  insects feed on the leek plants, and may cause secondary damage as fungal and  bacterial infections can cause the bulbs to rot. The adults are \u00bc inch long  brown moths, and the caterpillars are \u00bd inch long, creamy white with a brown  head and small legs. The caterpillars tunnel into the leaves causing yellow and  brown patches, and eventually bore into the stems. They emerge and spin a silky  net on the foliage. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends:  Use floating row covers. Hand pick caterpillars. Rotate crops. Remove plant  debris. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Onion Maggot:</strong> This insect causes stunted or wilted seedlings and damaged roots and bulbs. The  adult is a greyish colored fly which lays its eggs around the base of the  plant. The maggots bore into the roots. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Remove all bulbs at the  end of the season and remove all volunteer wild onion plants. Floating row  covers can prevent the females from laying eggs. Check with your Cooperative Extension Service  for pest controls. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Slugs: </strong>These  pests leave large holes in the foliage or eat leaves entirely. They leave a  slime trail, feed at night and are mostly a problem in damp weather.<strong> <em>Burpee  Recommends: Hand pick, at night if possible. You can try attracting the slugs  to traps either using cornmeal or beer. For a beer trap, dig a hole in the  ground and place a large cup or bowl into the hole; use something that has  steep sides so that the slugs can&rsquo;t crawl back out when they&rsquo;re finished. Fill  the bowl about \u00be of the way full with beer, and let it sit overnight. In the  morning, the bowl should be full of drowned slugs that can be dumped out for  the birds to eat. For a cornmeal trap, put a tablespoon or two of cornmeal in a  jar and put it on its side near the plants. Slugs are attracted to the scent  but they cannot digest it and it will kill them. You can also try placing a  barrier around your plants of diatomaceous earth or even coffee grounds. They  cannot crawl over these.</em></strong></p>\n<strong>Thrips: </strong>Thrips are tiny needle-thin insects that are black or straw colored.  They suck the juices of plants and attack flower petals, leaves and stems. The  plant will have a stippling, discolored flecking or silvering of the leaf  surface. Thrips can spread many diseases from plant to plant. <strong><em>Burpee  Recommends: Many thrips may be repelled by sheets of aluminum foil spread  between rows of plants. Remove weeds from the bed and remove debris from the  bed after frost. Check with your Cooperative Extension Service for pest  controls. </em></strong>'

          '<p><strong>What is blanching? </strong>Blanching is to turn something white. In the case of leeks, it is  covering the lower stem to keep it as white and tender as possible.<br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Can I grow leeks in containers?</strong> Yes, leeks are fine in containers. Be sure  to use a commercial potting mix rather than garden soil. <br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Are leeks perennial?</strong> No, leeks are biennial, but we grow them as annuals. Once they produce a  flower the second year they are not good for eating. <br>\n  <strong><br>\n  How can I use leeks as companion plants?</strong> Plant leeks with carrots, radishes, onions,  celery and beets. Do NOT plant near legumes such as beans and peas. <br>\n  <strong><br>\n  How many leeks will I get from each plant?</strong> Each leek plant produces one leek. Be sure  to separate the seedlings when planting. </p>'

Severely infected leaves turn brown, curl upward,  wither and die. Fruit are not usually infected but can suffer from sunscald due  to leaf loss. This disease is worse in warm, wet or very humid weather.<strong> <em>Burpee  Recommends: Avoid getting water on the foliage. Remove infected plant parts and  do not work around wet plants. Provide plenty of air circulation. Contact your  Cooperative Extension Service for fungicide recommendations.</em></strong><br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Anthracnose:</strong> This is a fungus disease that attacks  the fruit as it is ripening. Irregular brown spots develop on the leaves.  Infected fruit develop sunken black spots that may have white mycelia during  wet weather. The spots enlarge and turn black; the fruit rots. Extended periods  of heat and humidity facilitate anthracnose growth. The fungus overwinters in  diseased plant debris. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Provide sufficient space  between plants for good air circulation, avoid overhead watering which can  spread the fungus spores, keep a clean garden, remove and discard all diseased  plant material and rotate crops.</em></strong><br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Bacterial Wilt:</strong> Leaves turn brown, stems wilt and shrivel, the infected plants die. <strong><em>Burpee  Recommends: Remove and destroy plants showing signs of the disease. Control  cucumber beetles, which spread the disease. Contact your Cooperative Extension  Service for recommendations. </em></strong><br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Powdery Mildew: </strong>This fungus disease occurs on the top of the leaves in humid weather  conditions. The leaves appear to have a whitish or greyish surface and may  curl.<strong> <em>Burpee Recommends: Avoid powdery mildew by providing good air  circulation for the plants by good spacing and pruning. Contact your  Cooperative Extension Service for fungicide recommendations. </em></strong><br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Seed Rot and Damping  Off: </strong>This is a fungus disease that affects seeds and seedlings. Infected  seeds will not spout. Infected seedlings can have brown thin stems and the  plants will quickly die. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Do not sow seeds until  the soil has warmed to 65 degrees. Plant seeds in a raised hill that will warm  up earlier. Keep beds moist but not water logged. </em></strong><br>\n</p>\n<p><strong><em>Common Pest and  Cultural Problems</em></strong><br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Aphids: </strong>Greenish, red, black or peach colored sucking  insects can spread disease as they feed on the undersides of leaves.

Beetles are usually \u00bc to \u00bd inch in size. Beetles start feeding as soon as they  hatch and can kill or slow the growth of the plants. Beetle larva can also bore  through the roots of the plants. Beetles can also transmit diseases from plant  to plant. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Knock off  adults into a jar of soapy water and destroy them. Spade the soil to destroy  dormant beetles before you plant. Use a row cover to prevent adults from  feeding on young plants. Consult your  Cooperative Extension Service for insecticide recommendations. </em></strong><br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Fruit Splitting: </strong>This indicates that when the fruit was forming it did not get an even  supply of moisture from the roots. A sudden rush of water from sudden and heavy  summer rains through the stem can pop the skin of a ripening fruit like an  overfilled water balloon. The condition is particularly pronounced after a  drought when a summer storm delivers a great amount of water to the tissues in  the fruit. The skin cannot expand fast enough and splitting appears. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Take care with your  watering: instead of a quick sprinkle every day, water deeply once or twice a  week (depending on rainfall) so the moisture soaks deeply into the soil where  roots can take it up as needed. Soaker hoses can help. Stick your finger into  the soil every day to check that it is evenly moist a couple of inches below  the surface. </em></strong><br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Squash Bugs:</strong> Adults are 5/8 inch long and gray or  brown. Squash bugs give off a foul odor when crushed. Young nymphs have light  green abdomens and black heads and legs. As the nymphs grow they will change  color. Eggs are found in groups on the underside of leaves, eggs will be yellow  or brown. Squash bugs will feed on leaves and fruit.<strong><em> Burpee Recommends: Knock adults off into a jar of soapy water and  destroy them. Check for clusters of eggs on the back of leaves and destroy  them. Use a floating row cover to prevent females from laying eggs on plants.</em></strong><br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Spider Mites: </strong>These tiny spider-like pests are about  the size of a grain of pepper. They may be red, black, brown or yellow. They  suck on the plant juices removing chlorophyll and injecting toxins which cause  white dots on the foliage. There is often webbing visible on the plant. They  cause the foliage to turn yellow and become dry and stippled. They multiply  quickly and thrive in dry conditions. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Spider mites may  be controlled with a forceful spray every other day. Try hot pepper wax or  insecticidal soap. Check with your Cooperative Extension Service for miticide  recommendations. </em></strong><br>\n</p>'

          'FAQs',
          '<p><strong>Why does my fruit have  a bitter or poor flavor? </strong>Bitter flavor can be caused by a number of factors  including: hot and dry temperatures, overwatering, or poor soil fertilization.  Melons have shallow roots; make sure the soil is moist but never waterlogged.  Test your soil for nutrient deficiency.<br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Why do I have lots of leaves but no flowers? </strong>The  plant is likely getting too much nitrogen, which triggers it to grow foliage,  and not enough phosphorus, which favors flowering and fruiting. Choose a  fertilizer that has a balanced ratio of the three major elements, such as  10-10-10, or where the middle number (phosphorus) is larger than the first  number (nitrogen) such as 2-3-1. <br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Why do I have flowers but no fruit? </strong>\u00a0Cantaloupes  are &ldquo;Dioecious&rdquo;, meaning that they have both male and female flowers on the  same plant. Male flowers usually open first and female flowers have a baby  fruit behind the flower. Both<br>\ntypes of flowers must be present  to have fruit set.<strong> </strong>Flowers may abort because of heat or cold or  drought stress OR flowers abort because of a lack of pollination OR the plant  is not ready to set fruit and the plant is self-aborting flowers to conserve  and direct energy towards more growth.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>How  many melons per plant should I expect? </strong>Limit your fruit to 3-4 per plant. The more fruit  a vine supports, the smaller the fruit will be and the longer it will take to  ripen.<strong></strong><br>\n<br>\n<strong>Can  I ripen fruit off the vine? </strong>Regrettably,  no.\u00a0 Fruits are as ripe as they will ever  be the moment they are picked.\u00a0 <strong> </strong></p>'

The lesions may encircle the stems and  cause wilt. This disease is worse in warm, wet or very humid weather.<strong> <em>Burpee  Recommends: Avoid getting water on the foliage. Remove infected plant parts and  do not work around wet plants. Provide plenty of air circulation. Contact your  Cooperative Extension Service for fungicide recommendations.</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Bacterial Leaf Spot: </strong>This  causes brown water soaked spots on the foliage which eventually makes the  foliage turn yellow. It thrives in cooler temperatures. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Remove  infected plants. Rotate crops with plants in a different family. Avoid overhead  watering. Do not work around plants when they are wet. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Black Rot: </strong>This  bacterial disease thrives in warm and humid conditions and attacks the leaves.  Yellow-orange V shaped lesions occur on the edges of the leaves and eventually  dry out and the leaves fall. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Rotate crops with plants  in a different family. Avoid overhead watering. Provide adequate air  circulation, do not overcrowd plants. Do not work around plants when they are  wet. Control weeds where the disease can overwinter.</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Damping Off: </strong>This  is one of the most common problems when starting plants from seed. The seedling  emerges and appears healthy; then it suddenly wilts and dies for no obvious  reason. Damping off is caused by a fungus that is active when there is abundant  moisture and soils and air temperatures are above 68 degrees F. Typically, this  indicates that the soil is too wet or contains high amounts of nitrogen  fertilizer. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Keep seedlings moist but do not overwater; avoid  over-fertilizing your seedlings; thin out seedlings to avoid overcrowding; make  sure the plants are getting good air circulation; if you plant in containers,  thoroughly wash them in soapy water &amp; rinse in a ten per cent bleach  solution after use.</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Downy Mildew: </strong>This  fungus causes whitish grey patches on the undersides and eventually both sides  of the leaves. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Rotate crops with plants in a different family.

Fill  the bowl about \u00be of the way full with beer, and let it sit overnight. In the  morning, the bowl should be full of drowned slugs that can be dumped out for  the birds to eat. For a cornmeal trap, put a tablespoon or two of cornmeal in a  jar and put it on its side near the plants. Slugs are attracted to the scent  but they cannot digest it and it will kill them.

You can try attracting the slugs  to traps either using cornmeal or beer. For a beer trap, dig a hole in the  ground and place a large cup or bowl into the hole; use something that has  steep sides so that the slugs can&rsquo;t crawl back out when they&rsquo;re finished. Fill  the bowl about \u00be of the way full with beer, and let it sit overnight. In the  morning, the bowl should be full of drowned slugs that can be dumped out for  the birds to eat. For a cornmeal trap, put a tablespoon or two of cornmeal in a  jar and put it on its side near the plants. Slugs are attracted to the scent  but they cannot digest it and it will kill them. You can also try placing a  barrier around your plants of diatomaceous earth or even coffee grounds. They  cannot crawl over these.</em></strong></p>'

          '<p><strong><em>Common Disease Problems</em></strong><br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Alternaria Leaf Spot: </strong>Small, round reddish brown spots with white to grey centers form on the  upper surface of the leaves and along the midrib. The lesions may encircle the  stems and cause wilt. This disease is worse in warm, wet or very humid weather.<strong> <em>Burpee Recommends: Avoid getting water on the foliage. Remove infected plant  parts and do not work around wet plants. Provide plenty of air circulation.  Contact your Cooperative Extension Service for fungicide recommendations.</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Damping Off: </strong>This  is one of the most common problems when starting plants from seed. The seedling  emerges and appears healthy; then it suddenly wilts and dies for no obvious  reason. Damping off is caused by a fungus that is active when there is abundant  moisture and soils and air temperatures are above 68 degrees F. Typically, this  indicates that the soil is too wet or contains high amounts of nitrogen  fertilizer. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Keep seedlings moist but do not overwater; avoid  over-fertilizing your seedlings; thin out seedlings to avoid overcrowding; make  sure the plants are getting good air circulation; if you plant in containers,  thoroughly wash them in soapy water and rinse in a ten per cent bleach solution  after use.</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Fusarium Wilt: </strong>The first symptom of fusarium is the appearance of a few yellow leaves or  a slight drooping of the lower leaves. Caused by a soil-borne fungus, the  fungus enters through the roots and passes up into the stem producing toxic  substances. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Destroy  affected plants at the first sign of fusarium and rotate crops. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Root Knot Nematodes: </strong>Microscopic worm-like pests that cause swellings (galls) to form on  roots. Plants may wilt or appear stunted. This is a serious problem in many  Southern states. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Do  not plant into infested soil. Grow resistant varieties. Try planting  &lsquo;Nema-Gone&rsquo; marigolds around your plants. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Virus (Various causes):</strong> The most characteristic sign  of virus is irregular yellow mottling of the leaves. Young plants may have a  yellowish tone and become stunted. Spread by whiteflies. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: </em></strong><strong><em>Control  whiteflies. Remove and destroy infected plants. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><em><br>\n  Common Pest and  Cultural Problems</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Aphids: </strong>Greenish, red, black or peach colored sucking  insects can spread disease as they feed on the undersides of leaves. They leave  a sticky residue on foliage that attracts ants. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends:  Introduce or attract natural predators into your garden such as lady beetles  and wasps which feed on aphids. You can also wash them off with a strong spray,  or use an insecticidal soap. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Leafhoppers: </strong>Leafhoppers cause injury to leaves and  stunt growth. They also spread disease. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Remove plant  debris. Use insecticidal soaps. Consult your Cooperative Extension Service for  other insecticide recommendations. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Spider Mites: </strong>These tiny spider-like pests are about  the size of a grain of pepper. They may be red, black, brown or yellow. They  suck on the plant juices removing chlorophyll and injecting toxins which cause  white dots on the foliage. There is often webbing visible on the plant. They  cause the foliage to turn yellow and become dry and stippled. They multiply  quickly and thrive in dry conditions. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Spider mites may  be controlled with a forceful spray every other day. Try hot pepper wax or  insecticidal soap. Check with your Cooperative Extension Service for miticide  recommendations. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Thrips: </strong>Thrips are tiny  needle-thin insects that are black or straw colored. They suck the juices of  plants and attack flower petals, leaves and stems. The plant will have a  stippling, discolored flecking or silvering of the leaf surface. Thrips can  spread many diseases from plant to plant. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Many thrips  may be repelled by sheets of aluminum foil spread between rows of plants.  Remove weeds from the bed and remove debris from the bed after frost. Check  with your Cooperative Extension Service for pest controls. </em></strong><br>\n<strong><br>\nWhitefly: </strong>These are small  white flying insects that often rise up in a cloud when plants are disturbed or  brushed against.<strong> <em>Burpee Recommends: They are difficult to control without  chemicals. Try hot pepper wax or insecticidal soap. Check with your Cooperative  Extension Service for pesticide recommendations. </em></strong></p>'

          '<p><strong><em>Common Disease Problems</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Bacterial Soft Rot: </strong>This is mostly an issue with on mature bulbs. Affected scales first appear  water-soaked and pale yellow to light brown or bleached gray to white. As the disease  progresses, infected tissue becomes soft and sticky with the interior of the  bulb breaking-down. A watery, foul-smelling thick liquid can be squeezed from  the neck of diseased bulbs. It is spread by water and some insects through  wounds on the plant. <strong><em>Burpee  Recommends: Avoid overhead watering where possible, and control insect pests  such as onion maggot, that can spread it. Allow onion tops to mature before  harvesting and avoid damaging bulbs during harvest. Store onion bulbs only  after they have been properly dried, with good air circulation to prevent  moisture condensation from forming on the bulbs.</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Neck Rot: </strong>This  fungus mostly affects onions in storage. It enters plant tissue at the neck of  the bulb through a wound, most likely from cultivating or harvesting. The  tissue becomes soft and spongy with brown water soaked lesions. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Avoid overhead watering,  increase air circulation around plants and harvested bulbs. Avoid neck injury  when working with plants. Make sure bulbs are properly cured and are stored  dry. Remove infected plant debris.</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Onion Smut: </strong>This  fungus attacks mostly young seedlings as the new leaves emerge. It causes  blister-like lesions near the base of the bulb and streaks on leaves, sheaths  and bulbs. The streaks mature into black powdery spores. The fungus stunts the  growth of the plants. <br>\n  More mature plants are not as susceptible. It is most  prevalent in temperatures under 75 degrees F. The disease lives in the soil for  several years. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends:  Rotate crops and do not plant in the same area for at least three years.  Encourage rapid growth with watering and fertilizer to get plants past the  susceptible stage. Some fungicides are effective, check with your Cooperative Extension Service for recommendations. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Pink Root Rot: </strong>A fungus that attacks onion roots causing them to turn a light pink, then  red and eventually purple-brown and causing them to shrivel. Infected plants  show signs of nutrient deficiencies and drought because the roots cannot take  up water and nutrients. Plants are stunted. The disease lives in the soil for  several years and thrives in warm temperatures. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Plant as early as possible so the bulk of the plant  growth will be in cooler temperatures. Rotate crops and plant resistant  varieties. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Smudge: </strong>This  fungus occurs late in the season and can extend into storage. It causes dark  green to black lesions in concentric rings around the neck and on the surface  of the skin of the outer scales and can spread to inner scales and cause the  bulb to shrivel. It thrives in high humidity. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Practice crop rotation as the disease can live I the  soil for several years. Harvest only in dry conditions and cure properly.

          '<p><strong><em>Common Disease Problems</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Cavity Spot: </strong>This  fungus causes lesions that are sunken and grey and elliptical in shape. The  outer layer of the root ruptures and develops lesions. <strong><em>Burpee recommends: Do not over  fertilize, avoid areas that have previously had this problem as the disease  persists in the soil for several years. Contact your local Cooperative  Extension Service for fungicide recommendations.</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Damping Off: </strong>This  is one of the most common problems when starting plants from seed. The seedling  emerges and appears healthy; then it suddenly wilts and dies for no obvious  reason. Damping off is caused by a fungus that is active when there is abundant  moisture and soils and air temperatures are above 68 degrees F. Typically, this  indicates that the soil is too wet or contains high amounts of nitrogen  fertilizer. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Keep seedlings moist but do not overwater; avoid  over-fertilizing your seedlings; thin out seedlings to avoid overcrowding; make  sure the plants are getting good air circulation; if you plant in containers,  thoroughly wash them in soapy water and rinse in a ten per cent bleach solution  after use.</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Downy Mildew: </strong>This  fungus causes whitish grey patches on the undersides and eventually both sides  of the leaves. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Rotate crops with plants in a different family.  Avoid overhead watering. Provide adequate air circulation, do not overcrowd  plants. Do not work around plants when they are wet. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Itersonilia Canker: </strong>This fungus causes small brown necrotic lesions on leaves with pale green  halos. Red-brown cankers form on the root and shoulder with a rough texture.  This disease emerges late in the growing season and favored by cool, wet  weather. <strong><em>Burpee recommends: Keep the  shoulders covered with soil throughout the growing season. Rotate crops, keep  up with weed removal.</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Powdery Mildew: </strong>This fungus disease occurs on the top of the leaves in humid weather  conditions. The leaves appear to have a whitish or greyish surface and may  curl.<strong> <em>Burpee Recommends: Avoid powdery mildew by providing good air  circulation for the plants by good spacing and pruning. Contact your  Cooperative Extension Service for fungicide recommendations</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><em><br>\n  Common Pest and  Cultural Problems</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Aphids: </strong>Greenish, red, black or peach colored sucking  insects can spread disease as they feed on the undersides of leaves. They leave  a sticky residue on foliage that attracts ants. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends:  Introduce or attract natural predators into your garden such as lady beetles  and wasps which feed on aphids. You can also wash them off with a strong spray,  or use an insecticidal soap. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Armyworm</strong>: These  worms chew holes in leaves that can be singular or clumped together. Leaves can  become skeletonized. Egg clusters may be evident on foliage with a cottony or  fuzzy appearance. Young larvae are pale green and adults are darker with a  light line along the side<strong> </strong>and pink underside. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Introduce  natural enemies to the area. Handpick.</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Carrot Rust Fly: </strong>The  larvae of this small dark colored fly are white maggots about .3 inches in  length. They cause surface scarring on the taproot caused by the tunnels they  make in the root. The tunnels fill with a rust colored mush. They attack  members of the carrot family, including celery. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Use  floating row covers before the adult fly lays its eggs on the plants. Harvest  in blocks and do not leave any parsnips in the ground over the winter, or any  plant debris, to help prevent overwintering sites.</em></strong> <br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Cutworms</strong>: These insects cut off the seedlings at the  soil level. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Place a paper cup collar (use a coffee cut  with the bottom cut out) around the base of the plant. They are usually mostly  a problem with young seedlings. You can also control by handpicking and  controlling weeds, where they lay their eggs. </em></strong></p>\n<strong>Flea Beetles: </strong>These small hopping  beetles feed on plant foliage and may spread diseases. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Rotate crops with plants in a different plant  family. Use floating row covers to prevent damage to young foliage.</em></strong>'

It thrives in  cool wet weather conditions.<strong> <em>Burpee Recommends: Remove affected plant  parts, avoid watering at night and getting water on the plant when watering.  Make sure plants have good air circulation. Contact your Cooperative Extension  Service for fungicide recommendations. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Cylindrocladium Black  Rot: </strong>A fungus the causes yellowing and wilting of the leaves, and rapid  wilting of the whole plant when there is a period of drought after high  moisture. Clusters of red-brown fungal bodies occur on stems, pegs and pods,  the roots blacken, shrivel and rot. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Plant resistant varieties  and rotate crops. Contact your Cooperative Extension Service for fungicide  recommendations. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Cercospora Leaf  Blight: </strong>Small flecks which develop a yellowish halo appear on the leaves  and turn brown and coalesce. They cause the leaves to wither and die. <strong><em>Burpee  Recommends: Remove infected plants and destroy all plant debris. Rotate crops.</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Rust:</strong> A  number of fungus diseases that cause rust colored spots on foliage, stalks and  husks. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Plant early  as these diseases tend to be worse later in the season. Plant resistant varieties.  Practice crop rotation. Remove infected plants. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Verticillium Wilt:</strong> This causes a wilting of the leaves and stems on several branches. Leaf  margins cup upward, leaves turn yellow and drop off. If fruit is produced, it  is usually smaller than normal. Like fusarium this will enter through the  roots, migrating up the stem and plugging a plant's transport vessels. It is  transmitted in the soil. It can also be spread by water and tools. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Practice at least a 4  year crop rotation.

Raise the lights as the plants grow taller.  Incandescent bulbs will not work for this process because they will get too  hot. Most plants require a dark period to grow, do not leave lights on for 24  hours.</li>\r\n  <li>Seedlings  do not need much fertilizer, feed when they are 3-4 weeks old using a starter  solution (half strength of a complete indoor houseplant food) according to  manufacturer&rsquo;s directions. </li>\r\n  <li>If  you are growing in small cells, you may need to transplant the seedlings to 3  or 4 inch pots when seedlings have at least 3 pairs of leaves before  transplanting to the garden so they have enough room to develop strong roots</li>\r\n  <li>Before  planting in the garden, seedling plants need to be &ldquo;hardened off&rdquo;. Accustom  young plants to outdoor conditions by moving them to a sheltered place outside  for a week. Be sure to protect them from wind and hot sun at first. If frost  threatens at night, cover or bring containers indoors, then take them out again  in the morning. This hardening off process toughens the plant&rsquo;s cell structure  and reduces transplant shock and scalding.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Planting in the  Garden:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>To  get an early start with your pepper plants, particularly in the North, cover  the prepared bed with a dark colored polyethylene mulch at least a week before  transplanting. This will heat the soil beneath and provide a better growing  condition for young pepper plants. The mulch will also help the soil retain  moisture throughout the season as the pepper plants grow. </li>\r\n  <li>Select  a location in full sun with good rich moist organic soil. Make sure you did not  grow tomatoes, peppers, eggplant or potatoes in the bed the previous year to  avoid disease problems.</li>\r\n  <li>Prepare  the bed by turning the soil under to a depth of 8 inches. Level with a rake to  remove clumps of grass and stones. </li>\r\n  <li>Peppers  should be set 18 inches apart in a row with the rows spaced 2-3 feet apart. </li>\r\n  <li>Dig  a hole for each plant large enough to amply accommodate the root ball.\u00a0 </li>\r\n  <li>Carefully  remove the plant from its pot and gently loosen the root ball with your hands  to encourage good root development.\u00a0 </li>\r\n  <li>Fill  the planting hole with soil to the top and press soil down firmly with your  hand leaving a slight depression around the plant to hold water.\u00a0 </li>\r\n  <li>Use  the plant tag as a location marker.

This is  especially important for peppers as their roots may be easily damaged when  weeding, and this can lead to blossom end rot. </li>\n  <li>Keep  plants well-watered during the growing season, especially during dry spells.  Plants need about 1-2&quot; of rain per week during the growing season. Use a  rain gauge to check to see if you need to add water. It's best to water with a  drip or trickle system that delivers water at low pressure at the soil level.  If you water with overhead sprinklers, water early in the day so the foliage  has time to dry off before evening, to minimize disease problems. Keep the soil  moist but not saturated. </li>\n  <li>Note  that hot peppers tend to be hotter when they have less water and fertilizer. If  they receive plenty of water and fertilizer they may be more mild than  expected. </li>\n  <li>Monitor  for pests and diseases. Check with your local Cooperative Extension Service for  pest controls recommended for your area. </li>\n  <li>Try  planting pepper plants near tomatoes, parsley, basil, and carrots in your home  vegetable garden.

          'Tips',
          '<ul>\n  <li>Like cucumbers and summer squash, peppers are  usually harvested at an immature stage. The traditional bell pepper, for  example, is harvested green, even though most varieties will mature red,  orange, or yellow. Peppers may be harvested at any stage, but their flavor  doesn&rsquo;t fully develop until maturity. Fully ripe peppers in multi-colors are  delightful in the garden as well as in salads.</li>\n  <li>Cut the fruit from the plant with a sharp knife  or pruners leaving a small part of the stem attached. </li>\n  <li>Sweet bell, pimento and cherry peppers are  delicious eaten green but are sweeter and higher in vitamins if allowed to turn  bright red before harvest. Some varieties are yellow at maturity or may mature  from green through yellow and red. </li>\n  <li>Hot peppers may be harvested at any stage.  Anaheim is usually picked green and cayenne types red. </li>\n  <li>Bell peppers may be chopped and quick frozen for  use in many recipes; sweet cherry and banana peppers and hot cherry peppers are  perfect for pickling. </li>\n  <li>A popular and trouble-free way to store hot  peppers is to dry them. String mature red peppers by piercing the stem with a  needle and heavy thread. Hang the string in a warm, dry, airy place (not in the  sun!) to dry. They can make a colorful kitchen accent. Pull a pepper from the  string when you need one. Hot peppers remain hot even after they are dried.  Remember that in recipes a little hot pepper can go a long way. </li>\n  <li>Please note that hot peppers can burn sensitive  skin on contact and fumes from grinding or cooking them can irritate the lungs  and eyes. When working with hot peppers use rubber gloves and wash your hands  before touching your face or eyes. </li>\n</ul>'

          '<p><strong><em>Common Disease Problems</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Leaf Spots: </strong>These  are caused by various pathogens. Spots on the foliage may appear in cool, moist  weather and plants may become defoliated. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Provide  sufficient space between plants for good air circulation, avoid overhead  watering which can spread the fungus spores, keep a clean garden, remove and  discard all diseased plant material and rotate crops. Use a mulch to prevent  spores from splashing from the soil onto plants. Contact your Cooperative  Extension Service for fungicide recommendations.</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Phytophthora Blight: </strong>This disease causes plants to become girdled at the soil line and wilt. Dark  water soaked patches appear on the fruit or the fruit withers. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Rotate crops with plants  in a different family. Plant in containers using a fresh container potting mix.  Consult your Cooperative Extension  Service for other fungicide recommendations. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Root Knot Nematodes: </strong>Microscopic worm-like pests that  cause swellings (galls) to form on roots. Plants may wilt or appear stunted. This  is a serious problem in many Southern states. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: </em></strong><strong><em>Do not plant into infested soil. Grow  resistant varieties. Try planting &lsquo;Nema-Gone&rsquo; marigolds around your plants. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Verticillium Wilt: </strong>This fungus causes a wilting of the leaves and stems on several branches.  Leaf margins cup upward, leaves turn yellow and drop off. If fruit is produced,  it is usually smaller than normal. It will enter the plant through the roots,  migrate up the stem and plug a plant&rsquo;s transport vessels. It is transmitted in  the soil. It can also be spread by water and tools. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Practice at least a 4 year crop rotation. Remove and  burn crop debris. Plant resistant varieties.</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Walnut Wilt: </strong>Walnut  Wilt causes overall wilting of plants, or dwarfed growth, in close proximity to  living walnut tree. Some or all plants in a planting may be affected. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Do not plant peppers near  Black Walnut trees. These trees exude a toxin from their roots which kills many  plants. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><em><br>\n  Common Pest and  Cultural Problems</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Aphids: </strong>Greenish, red, black or peach colored sucking  insects can spread disease as they feed on the undersides of leaves. They leave  a sticky residue on foliage that attracts ants. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends:  Introduce or attract natural predators into your garden such as lady beetles  and wasps which feed on aphids. You can also wash them off with a strong spray,  or use an insecticidal soap. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Flea Beetles: </strong>These  small hopping beetles feed on plant foliage and may spread diseases. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Rotate crops with plants  in a different plant family. Use floating row covers to prevent damage to young  foliage.</em></strong> <strong></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Leafhoppers: </strong>Leafhoppers cause injury to leaves and  stunt growth. They also spread disease. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Remove plant  debris. Use insecticidal soaps. Consult your Cooperative Extension Service for  other insecticide recommendations. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Spider mites: </strong>These tiny spider-like pests are about  the size of a grain of pepper. They may be red, black, brown or yellow. They  suck on the plant juices removing chlorophyll and injecting toxins which cause  white dots on the foliage. There is often webbing visible on the plant. They  cause the foliage to turn yellow and become dry and stippled. They multiply  quickly and thrive in dry conditions. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Spider mites may  be controlled with a forceful spray every other day. Try hot pepper wax or  insecticidal soap. Check with your Cooperative Extension Service for miticide  recommendations. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Tomato Horn Worm: </strong>Large, green caterpillars which can  quickly devour foliage<strong>. <em>Burpee Recommends: With sturdy gloves on, hand  pick and destroy them. HOWEVER if you see white projections coming from the  back of the caterpillar, do not destroy it. These are the egg cases of a  parasitic wasp that will destroy the caterpillar. These wasps should be allowed  to remain in your garden.</em></strong></p>'

          '<p><strong>What is your hottest hot pepper?</strong> Caribbean Red, a Habanero-type, its heat  index is 300,000-475,000 Scovilles. The hottest pepper, Ghost Pepper also called  Bhut Jolokia, is 1,001,304 Scovilles. Burpee does not offer Ghost pepper seed  or plants.<br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Why is my hot pepper not hot?</strong> Hot peppers are their hottest when the growing season is hot. Too much  cold, mild or rainy weather will dim the torch of any hot pepper OR too much  water and or too much fertilizer will affect pepper heat, usually diluting it.<br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Why is my pepper green and not red? </strong>Most peppers are green or light yellow before  they turn yellow, orange or red.<strong> </strong>In cooler climates or during a cool  season, it takes longer for a pepper to change color than in warmer climates or  during a hot season.<strong> </strong>It can take two to four weeks for a pepper to  change color when it reaches its mature size. <strong></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Can I grow peppers indoors?</strong> Peppers are surprisingly good houseplants. Give them lots of bright  light from a south facing window, regular fertilizer and even moisture and they  can delight you all winter long. Select a smaller ornamental or specialty  pepper to fit on a window sill. Be sure to hand pollinate.<br>\n  <strong><br>\n  How are my plants pollinated indoors? </strong>Gently shake and mist your plants to  encourage self-pollination. \u00a0<strong></strong></p>'

Make sure you did not  grow tomatoes, peppers, eggplant or potatoes in the bed the previous year to  avoid disease problems. Potatoes prefer a soil pH of 4.8 to 6.0. Avoid poorly  drained soils. Do not plant potatoes in freshly turned grass sod to avoid  wireworms.</li>\n  <li>Prepare  the bed by turning the soil under to a depth of 8 inches. Level with a rake to  remove clumps of grass and stones. </li>\n  <li>Plant  the entire mini-tuber, do not cut it up into smaller pieces. Lay the mini-tuber  in a trench 4-5 inches deep and 6-8 inches wide and apply a light fertilizer at  the bottom of the trench. Space the potatoes 10 to 12 inches apart with eyes up  and cover with 2 or 3 inches of soil in rows spaced 2 feet apart. </li>\n  <li>If  there is danger of frost cover the rows with newspaper until the shoots are 3-4  inches tall or the danger of frost is over. Plants emerge in 4-6 weeks. </li>\n  <li>When  plants are about 5 inches tall, hill up the soil from the sides of the trench  around each plant almost covering the foliage, but allowing 2 inches of foliage  to remain above the soil. </li>\n  <li>Continue  this hilling process as the plants grow, usually about every two weeks. The  hills keep the plants cool and prevent the potatoes from forming near the  surface where light will cause the tubers to turn green and become poisonous.

Irregular brown spots develop on the leaves.\u00a0 Fruit infection is sunken black spots that  may have white mycelia during wet weather. The spots enlarge and turn black;  the fruit rots. Extended periods of heat and humidity facilitate anthracnose  growth. The fungus overwinters in diseased plant debris. <strong><em>Burpee  Recommends: Provide sufficient space between plants for good air circulation,  avoid overhead watering which can spread the fungus spores, keep a clean  garden, remove and discard all diseased plant material and rotate crops.</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Bacterial Wilt:</strong> Leaves turn brown, stems wilt and shrivel, the infected plants die. <strong><em>Burpee  Recommends: Remove and destroy plants showing signs of the disease. Control  cucumber beetles, which spread the disease. Contact your Cooperative Extension  Service for recommendations. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Black Rot:</strong> This starts while  the fruit is in the garden but symptoms may not show up until fruit is stored.  Bronze, brown or black patches appear on the fruit before or after harvest.  Fruit will quickly collapse and rot. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Avoid getting  water on the fruit. Keep fruit off the ground with a mulch like straw. Do not  store wet fruit. Provide plenty of air circulation during storage. Contact your  Cooperative Extension Service for fungicide recommendations.</em></strong><strong></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Mosaic Virus: </strong>Young  leaves are distorted and mature leaves will have an intensive mottled  appearance. Fruit can have yellow spots or bumps. The disease is quite serious  and be transmitted by aphids or cucumber beetles. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Remove and  destroy any infected plant. The virus can overwinter in weeds so keep the  garden clean. Monitor and treat for aphids and cucumber beetles. Contact your  Cooperative Extensions Service for recommendations in your area. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Powdery Mildew: </strong>This fungus disease occurs on the top of the leaves in humid weather  conditions. The leaves appear to have a whitish or greyish surface and may  curl.<strong> <em>Burpee Recommends: Avoid powdery mildew by providing good air  circulation for the plants by good spacing and pruning.

You can also wash them off with a strong spray,  or use an insecticidal soap. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Blossom End Rot: </strong>Ends of the squash gets soft before they are  ready to harvest. This can occur when there is not enough calcium in the soil  or when root damage and water stress reduce the uptake and movement of calcium  through a plant. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends:  To avoid BER, properly site and prepare your garden bed before planting. Most  crops need full sun and loose, well-drained organic soil. Test your soil to see  if calcium is recommended. If it is, apply lime in the recommended quantity  according to manufacturer's instructions.\u00a0  Avoid planting too early in cool soils as this can inhibit early root  development, making the plant more susceptible to BER. Avoid wide fluctuations  in soil moisture by applying 2-3 inches of mulch. This will moderate the  release of water to plant roots, and also keep the soil from drying out when it  is directly exposed to the sun.</em>\u00a0 </strong><strong></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Cucumber Beetles: </strong>Beetles<strong> </strong>may be spotted, striped or banded and can be very harmful.  Beetles are usually \u00bc to \u00bd inch in size. Beetles start feeding as soon as they  hatch and can kill or slow the growth of the plants. Beetle larva can also bore  through the roots of the plants. Beetles can also transmit diseases from plant  to plant. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Knock off  adults into a jar of soapy water and destroy them. Spade the soil to destroy  dormant beetles before you plant. Use a row cover to prevent adults from  feeding on young plants. Consult your  Cooperative Extension Service for other insecticide recommendations. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Squash Vine Borer: </strong>The brown headed larva will bore into stems, feed through the center of  the stems, block the flow of water and the plants will collapse and die. The  first sign of this pest is that the plant will wilt during the day and perk up  at night. Check the base of the plant for holes and you will see what looks  like sawdust. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Pull  and destroy any plants killed by squash vine borers. Row covers will prevent  the female from laying her eggs. In most areas there is only one generation  each year so a second crop can be planted in early July. Although you can&rsquo;t  always save the plant, as soon as you see the wilting plant, cut a slit in the  stem above the hole using a sharp knife. Kill the borer with the tip of the  knife, or pull it out. Mound soil over the cut area and keep the soil moist.  New roots may grow and the plant may live. Rotate crops. Consult your Cooperative Extension Service for insecticide  recommendations. \u00a0</em></strong></p>\n<strong>Spider mites: </strong>These tiny spider-like pests are about the size  of a grain of pepper. They may be red, black, brown or yellow. They suck on the  plant juices removing chlorophyll and injecting toxins which cause white dots  on the foliage. There is often webbing visible on the plant. They cause the  foliage to turn yellow and become dry and stippled. They multiply quickly and  thrive in dry conditions. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Spider mites may be  controlled with a forceful spray every other day. Try hot pepper wax or  insecticidal soap. Check with your Cooperative Extension Service for miticide  recommendations. </em></strong>"

          '<p><strong>Why does my plant  have only male flowers? </strong>Male flowers open two weeks before female flowers  open. If plants are stressed (too hot, too cold, too crowded, too wet, too dry,  or infested) they will abort female flowers almost immediately.<br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Why do my plants have  flowers but no fruit? </strong>If flower stems are thin and straight, they are male  flowers; if flower stems are round and swollen like a baby fruit, they are  female flowers.\u00a0 You need both to make fruit. Male flowers will open before  female flowers. You can hand pollinate if there are no bees by rubbing the male  flower&rsquo;s pollen on the female flower.<br>\n  <strong><br>\n  If my squash are next  to my pumpkins, will I get mixed (hybrid) fruit? </strong>No, it will not affect the  fruit; however, you cannot save the seeds as this will be a mixed type of  fruit.<br>\n  <strong><br>\n  What pumpkins are  best for pumpkin pie? </strong>\u00a0Smaller,  heavier pumpkins like &lsquo;Early Sweet Sugar Pie&rsquo; are the best for pies.  Interestingly, while there are pie pumpkins, it is the winter squash Butternut  that is heralded by cooks who know as the best for pie-filling.<br>\n  <strong><br>\n  How do I grow big  pumpkins? </strong>When growing big pumpkins remove all but one pumpkin per plant,  that way are the plants energy will go into that pumpkin.\u00a0 Make sure you give the plant plenty of space  to spread. Fertilize regularly and keep the soil evenly moist. </p>'

          '<p><strong><em>Common Disease Problems</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Alternaria Leaf Spot</strong><strong>: </strong>Small, round reddish brown spots with white to gray centers form  on the upper surface of the leaves. The lesions may encircle the stems and  cause wilt. This disease is worse in warm, wet or very humid weather.<strong> <em>Burpee  Recommends: Avoid getting water on the foliage. Remove infected plant parts and  do not work around wet plants. Provide plenty of air circulation. Contact your  Cooperative Extension Service for fungicide recommendations.</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Bacterial Leaf Spot: </strong>This  causes brown water soaked spots on the foliage which eventually makes the  foliage turn yellow. It thrives in cooler temperatures. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Remove  infected plants. Rotate crops with plants in a different family. Avoid overhead  watering. Do not work around plants when they are wet. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Black Rot: </strong>This  bacterial disease thrives in warm and humid conditions and attacks the leaves.  Yellow-orange V shaped lesions occur on the edges of the leaves and eventually  dry out and the leaves fall. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Rotate crops with plants  in a different family. Avoid overhead watering. Provide adequate air  circulation, do not overcrowd plants. Do not work around plants when they are  wet. Control weeds, where the disease can overwinter.</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Damping Off: </strong>This  is one of the most common problems when starting plants from seed. The seedling  emerges and appears healthy; then it suddenly wilts and dies for no obvious  reason. Damping off is caused by a fungus that is active when there is abundant  moisture and soils and air temperatures are above 68 degrees F. Typically, this  indicates that the soil is too wet or contains high amounts of nitrogen  fertilizer. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Keep seedlings moist but do not overwater; avoid  over-fertilizing your seedlings; thin out seedlings to avoid overcrowding; make  sure the plants are getting good air circulation; if you plant in containers,  thoroughly wash them in soapy water and rinse in a ten per cent bleach solution  after use.</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Downy Mildew: </strong>This  fungus causes whitish gray patches on the undersides and eventually both sides  of the leaves. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Rotate crops with plants in a different family.  Avoid overhead watering. Provide adequate air circulation, do not overcrowd  plants. Do not work around plants when they are wet. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><em><br>\n  Common Pest and  Cultural Problems</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Aphids: </strong>Greenish, red, black or peach colored sucking  insects can spread disease as they feed on the undersides of leaves. They leave  a sticky residue on foliage that attracts ants. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends:  Introduce or attract natural predators into your garden such as lady beetles  and wasps who feed on aphids. You can also wash them off with a strong spray,  or use an insecticidal soap. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Cabbage Looper: </strong>These worms are  green with a white stripe on either side, about 1-1.5 inches long. They tunnel  through the heads. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Hand pick. Floating row covers can  help prevent their laying eggs on the plants. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Flea Beetles: </strong>These  small hopping beetles feed on plant foliage and spread diseases. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Rotate crops with plants  in a different plant family. Use floating row covers to prevent damage to young  foliage.</em></strong> <br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Leafminers: </strong>These insects bore  just under the leaf surface causing irregular serpentine lines. The larvae are  yellow cylindrical maggots and the adults are small black and yellow flies.  They do not usually kill plants, but disfigure the foliage.<strong> <em>Burpee  Recommends: Remove affected foliage. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Slugs: </strong>These  pests leave large holes in the foliage or eat leaves entirely. They leave a  slime trail, feed at night and are mostly a problem in damp weather.<strong> <em>Burpee  Recommends: Hand pick, at night if possible. You can try attracting the slugs  to traps either using cornmeal or beer. For a beer trap, dig a hole in the  ground and place a large cup or bowl into the hole; use something that has  steep sides so that the slugs can&rsquo;t crawl back out when they&rsquo;re finished. Fill  the bowl about \u00be of the way full with beer, and let it sit overnight. In the  morning, the bowl should be full of drowned slugs that can be dumped out for  the birds to eat. For a cornmeal trap, put a tablespoon or two of cornmeal in a  jar and put it on its side near the plants. Slugs are attracted to the scent  but they cannot digest it and it will kill them. You can also try placing a  barrier around your plants of diatomaceous earth or even coffee grounds. They  cannot crawl over these.</em></strong></p>'

For a cornmeal trap,  put a tablespoon or two of cornmeal in a jar and put it on its side near the  plants. Slugs are attracted to the scent but they cannot digest it and it will  kill them. You can also try placing a barrier around your plants of  diatomaceous earth or even coffee grounds. They cannot crawl over these.</em></strong>'

          '<p><strong>My roots arrived moldy, are they ok? Will it spread to other plants? </strong>This is just a surface mold from shipping and may be wiped off before planting. If the roots are firm and not slimy they are good to plant. It will not affect other plants.<br><strong><br>I used to grow rhubarb in Wisconsin, can I grow it here in Florida/Southern California? </strong>No, this is a perennial vegetable that needs a cold dormant period. It will not thrive in zones 9-10.<br><strong><br>Can I eat the leaves or roots? </strong>No, all parts of the plant are toxic except the stems.<br><strong><br>Can I grow rhubarb from seed?</strong> Burpee does not offer seed but yes, rhubarb can be grown from seed. It will take several years before you will be able to harvest stalks. <br><strong><br>Can I grow rhubarb in containers?</strong> We do not recommend growing rhubarb in containers. The large plants tend to be heavy feeders and not to thrive in containers.</p>'

          '<p><strong><em>Common Disease Problems</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Alternaria Leaf Spot: </strong>Small, round reddish brown spots with white to gray centers form on the  upper surface of the leaves and along the midrib. The lesions may encircle the  stems and cause wilt. This disease is worse in warm, wet or very humid weather.<strong> <em>Burpee Recommends: Avoid getting water on the foliage. Remove infected plant  parts and do not work around wet plants. Provide plenty of air circulation.  Contact your Cooperative Extension Service for fungicide recommendations.</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Anthracnose:</strong> This is a fungus disease causes circular  or irregularly shaped dry spots grey to straw color on the leaves. The lesions  may coalesce and form dead tissue that turns yellow, or they may split or crack  in the center. The fungus overwinters in diseased plant debris. <strong><em>Burpee  Recommends: Provide sufficient space between plants for good air circulation,  avoid overhead watering which can spread the fungus spores, keep a clean  garden, remove and discard all diseased plant material and rotate crops. Rotate  crops.</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Cercospora Leaf  Blight: </strong>Small flecks which develop a yellowish halo appear on the leaves  and turn brown and coalesce. They cause the leaves to wither and die. <strong><em>Burpee  Recommends: Remove infected plants and destroy all plant debris. Rotate crops.</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Clubroot: </strong>Leaf  symptoms include stunting, yellowing and wilt. When the plants are removed from  the roots may have galls, swelling and distortion of the roots.<strong> <em>Burpee Recommends: Test the soil pH Clubroot  is most common in acid soil and lime to raise pH. Avoid planting where Brassica  plants were grown the previous year.</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Downy Mildew: </strong>This  fungus causes whitish gray patches on the undersides and eventually both sides  of the leaves. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Rotate crops with plants in a different family.  Avoid overhead watering. Provide adequate air circulation, do not overcrowd  plants. Do not work around plants when they are wet. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><em>Common Pest and  Cultural Problems</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Aphids: </strong>Greenish, red, black or peach colored sucking  insects can spread disease as they feed on the undersides of leaves. They leave  a sticky residue on foliage that attracts ants. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends:  Introduce or attract natural predators into your garden such as lady beetles  and wasps which feed on aphids. You can also wash them off with a strong spray,  or use an insecticidal soap. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Cutworms</strong>: These insects cut off the seedlings at the  soil level. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Place a paper cup collar (use a coffee cut  with the bottom cut out) around the base of the plant. They are usually mostly  a problem with young seedlings. You can also control by handpicking and  controlling weeds, where they lay their eggs. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Flea Beetles: </strong>These  small hopping beetles feed on plant foliage and may spread diseases. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Rotate crops with plants  in a different plant family.

These maggots are white and feed on the  roots. They leave brown tunnels in the root.\u00a0 <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Introduce natural enemies to the area. Check  with your Cooperative Extension Service for pesticide recommendations which  must be applied prior to planting.</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Wireworms: </strong>These insects live  in the soil and kill seedlings by girdling their stems at the soil line, bore  into stems, roots and tubers. They may be found around the stems in the soil  are and \u00bc to \u00be inch long, thin, yellow brown worms with a shiny skin.

          'FAQs',
          '<p><strong>How do I tell the  difference between a turnip and rutabaga? What&rsquo;s the difference between a  rutabaga and a swede?</strong> Rutabagas are larger and yellow-fleshed. Turnips are  smaller and white fleshed. Rutabagas take longer to mature and store longer and  the flavor tends to be milder and sweeter than a turnip&rsquo;s. A rutabaga is  probably a hybrid of a cabbage and a turnip. Both are members of the cabbage  family. Rutabagas are also called swedes, or Swedish turnips. <br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Can I grow rutabagas  in a container?</strong> Yes, just be sure to leave plenty of space for them to  develop into 3-4 inch globes. Use a commercial planting mix rather than garden  soil. <br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Can I start rutabagas  indoors?</strong> We recommend direct sowing rutabagas because they develop an  enlarged tap root and may be damaged in transplanting. <br>\n  <strong><br>\n  If my rutabaga  sprouts in storage, should I plant it again?</strong> Planting it again will not  provide another root to harvest, so just cut off any growth and use the root as  soon as possible. <br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Can I eat the greens  of rutabaga?</strong> Yes the greens are edible. The young leaves are best raw, the  older ones steamed or boiled.</p>'

You can try attracting the slugs  to traps either using cornmeal or beer. For a beer trap, dig a hole in the  ground and place a large cup or bowl into the hole; use something that has  steep sides so that the slugs can&rsquo;t crawl back out when they&rsquo;re finished. Fill  the bowl about \u00be of the way full with beer, and let it sit overnight. In the  morning, the bowl should be full of drowned slugs that can be dumped out for  the birds to eat. For a cornmeal trap, put a tablespoon or two of cornmeal in a  jar and put it on its side near the plants. Slugs are attracted to the scent  but they cannot digest it and it will kill them. You can also try placing a  barrier around your plants of diatomaceous earth or even coffee grounds. They  cannot crawl over these.</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Thrips: </strong>Thrips are tiny  needle-thin insects that are black or straw colored. They suck the juices of  plants and attack flower petals, leaves and stems. The plant will have a  stippling, discolored flecking or silvering of the leaf surface. Thrips can  spread many diseases from plant to plant. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Many thrips  may be repelled by sheets of aluminum foil spread between rows of plants. Remove  weeds from the bed and remove debris from the bed after frost. Check with your  Cooperative Extension Service for pest controls. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Wireworms: </strong>These insects live  in the soil and kill seedlings by girdling their stems at the soil line, bore  into stems, and bulbs. They may be found around the stems in the soil are and \u00bc  to \u00be inch long, thin, yellow brown worms with a shiny skin. The adults are  called click beetles, and are about 1/3 inch long, reddish brown with a hard  shell. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Rotate crops.

          "<p><strong><em>Common Disease Problems</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Alternaria Leaf Spot: </strong>Small, round reddish brown spots, usually with a yellow halo, form on the  upper surface of the leaves. Severely infected leaves turn brown, curl upward,  wither and die. Fruit are not usually infected but can suffer from sunscald due  to leaf loss. This disease is worse in warm, wet or very humid weather.<strong> <em>Burpee  Recommends: Avoid getting water on the foliage. Remove infected plant parts and  do not work around wet plants. Provide plenty of air circulation. Contact your  Cooperative Extension Service for fungicide recommendations.</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Anthracnose:</strong> This is a fungus disease that attacks  the fruit as it is ripening. Irregular brown spots develop on the leaves.\u00a0 Fruit infection is sunken black spots that  may have white mycelia during wet weather. The spots enlarge and turn black;  the fruit rots. Extended periods of heat and humidity facilitate anthracnose  growth. The fungus overwinters in diseased plant debris. <strong><em>Burpee  Recommends: Provide sufficient space between plants for good air circulation,  avoid overhead watering which can spread the fungus spores, keep a clean  garden, remove and discard all diseased plant material and rotate crops.</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Bacterial Wilt:</strong> Leaves turn brown, stems wilt and shrivel, the infected plants die. <strong><em>Burpee  Recommends: Remove and destroy plants showing signs of the disease. Control  cucumber beetles, which spread the disease. Contact your Cooperative Extension  Service for fungicide recommendations. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Black Rot:</strong> This starts while  the fruit is in the garden but symptoms may not show up until fruit is stored.  Bronze, brown or black patches appear on the fruit before or after harvest.  Fruit will quickly collapse and rot. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Avoid getting  water on the fruit. Keep fruit off the ground with a mulch like straw. Do not  store wet fruit. Provide plenty of air circulation during storage. Contact your  Cooperative Extension Service for fungicide recommendations.</em></strong><strong></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Mosaic Virus: </strong>Young  leaves are distorted and mature leaves will have an intensive mottled  appearance. Fruit can have yellow spots or bumps. The disease is quite serious  and be transmitted by aphids or cucumber beetles. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Remove and  destroy any infected plant. The virus can overwinter in weeds so keep the  garden clean. Monitor and treat for aphids and cucumber beetles. Contact your  Cooperative Extensions Service for recommendations in your area. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Powdery Mildew: </strong>This fungus disease occurs on the top of the leaves in humid weather  conditions. The leaves appear to have a whitish or greyish surface and may  curl.<strong> <em>Burpee Recommends: Avoid powdery mildew by providing good air  circulation for the plants by good spacing and pruning. Contact your  Cooperative Extension Service for fungicide recommendations. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><em><br>\n  Common Pest and  Cultural Problems</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Aphids: </strong>Greenish, red, black or peach colored sucking  insects can spread disease as they feed on the undersides of leaves. They leave  a sticky residue on foliage that attracts ants. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends:  Introduce or attract natural predators into your garden such as lady beetles  and wasps who feed on aphids. You can also wash them off with a strong spray,  or use an insecticidal soap. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Blossom End Rot: </strong>Ends of the squash gets soft before they are  ready to harvest. This can occur when there is not enough calcium in the soil  or when root damage and water stress reduce the uptake and movement of calcium  through a plant. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends:  To avoid BER, properly site and prepare your garden bed before planting. Most  crops need full sun and loose, well-drained organic soil. Test your soil to see  if calcium is recommended. If it is, apply lime in the recommended quantity  according to manufacturer's instructions.\u00a0  Avoid planting too early in cool soils as this can inhibit early root  development, making the plant more susceptible to BER. Avoid wide fluctuations  in soil moisture by applying 2-3 inches of mulch. This will moderate the  release of water to plant roots, and also keep the soil from drying out when it  is directly exposed to the sun.</em>\u00a0 </strong><strong></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Cucumber Beetles: </strong>Beetles<strong> </strong>may be spotted, striped or banded and can be very harmful.  Beetles are usually \u00bc to \u00bd inch in size. Beetles start feeding as soon as they  hatch and can kill or slow the growth of the plants. Beetle larva can also bore  through the roots of the plants. Beetles can also transmit diseases from plant  to plant. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Knock off  adults into a jar of soapy water and destroy them. Spade the soil to destroy  dormant beetles before you plant. Use a row cover to prevent adults from  feeding on young plants. Consult your  Cooperative Extension Service for other insecticide recommendations. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Squash Vine Borer: </strong>The brown headed larva will bore into stems, feed through the center of  the stems, block the flow of water and the plants will collapse and die. The  first sign of this pest is that the plant will wilt during the day and perk up  at night. Check the base of the plant for holes and you will see what looks  like sawdust. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Pull  and destroy any plants killed by squash vine borers. Row covers will prevent  the female from laying her eggs. In most areas there is only one generation  each year so a second crop can be planted in early July. Although you can&rsquo;t  always save the plant, as soon as you see the wilting plant, cut a slit in the  stem above the hole using a sharp knife. Kill the borer with the tip of the  knife, or pull it out. Mound soil over the cut area and keep the soil moist.  New roots may grow and the plant may live. Rotate crops. Consult your Cooperative Extension Service for insecticide recommendations.  \u00a0</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Spider mites: </strong>These tiny spider-like pests are about  the size of a grain of pepper. They may be red, black, brown or yellow. They  suck on the plant juices removing chlorophyll and injecting toxins which cause  white dots on the foliage. There is often webbing visible on the plant. They  cause the foliage to turn yellow and become dry and stippled. They multiply  quickly and thrive in dry conditions. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Spider mites may  be controlled with a forceful spray every other day. Try hot pepper wax or  insecticidal soap. Check with your Cooperative Extension Service for miticide  recommendations. </em></strong></p>"

Infected roots develop a firm, black  dry rot with lesions that enlarge. Black cankers form on the underground parts  of the stem. Plants may be stunted, wilt and leaves may turn yellow and drop. <strong><em>Burpee  Recommends: Rotate crops with plants in a different family. Avoid overhead  watering. Provide adequate air circulation, do not overcrowd plants. Do not  work around plants when they are wet. Control weeds where the disease can  overwinter.</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Dry Rot: </strong>This  mostly affects sweet potatoes in storage, but can occasionally affect plants in  the garden. It progresses from one end and causes the sweet potato to shrink or  wrinkle. Affected tissue is light to dark brown externally and dark brown to  black internally. Affected roots become mummified. Sprouts from infected seed  roots may develop a reddish-brown to black decay at the base.<strong> </strong><strong><em>Burpee  Recommends: Rotate crops with plants in a different family.

Discoloration of the vascular tissues of the stem occurs earlier.  Frequently, the symptoms are one-sided. They are more severe when soil moisture  is low. The fungus persists in the soil for many years. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Practice crop rotation and plat resistant varieties. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Root Knot Nematodes: </strong>Microscopic worm-like pests that cause swellings (galls) to form on  roots.

          '<p><strong><em>Common Disease Problems</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Basal Rot: </strong>This  fungus invades through the roots and can infect the base of the petioles. It is  more prevalent in warm, moist soils. <strong><em>Burpee  Recommends: Avoid overwatering in warm months and provide good drainage. Contact  your Cooperative Extension Service for recommendations. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Cercospora Leaf  Blight: </strong>Small flecks which develop a yellowish halo appear on the leaves  and turn brown and coalesce. They cause the leaves to wither and die. <strong><em>Burpee  Recommends: Remove infected plants and destroy all plant debris. Rotate crops.</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Curlytop: </strong>This  is a virus disease that is characterized by yellowing, stunting and eventual  death of plants. It is spread by leafhoppers. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Control the leafhoppers which spread the disease and  remove and destroy infected plants.</em></strong> <br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Damping Off: </strong>This  is one of the most common problems when starting plants from seed. The seedling  emerges and appears healthy; then it suddenly wilts and dies for no obvious  reason. Damping off is caused by a fungus that is active when there is abundant  moisture and soils and air temperatures are above 68 degrees F. Typically, this  indicates that the soil is too wet or contains high amounts of nitrogen  fertilizer. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Keep seedlings moist but do not overwater; avoid  over-fertilizing your seedlings; thin out seedlings to avoid overcrowding; make  sure the plants are getting good air circulation; if you plant in containers,  thoroughly wash them in soapy water and rinse in a ten per cent bleach solution  after use.</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Downy Mildew: </strong>This  fungus causes whitish grey patches on the undersides and eventually both sides  of the leaves. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Rotate crops with plants in a different family.  Avoid overhead watering. Provide adequate air circulation, do not overcrowd  plants. Do not work around plants when they are wet. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><em><br>\n  Common Pest and Cultural  Problems</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Aphids: </strong>Greenish, red, black or peach colored sucking  insects can spread disease as they feed on the undersides of leaves. They leave  a sticky residue on foliage that attracts ants. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends:  Introduce or attract natural predators into your garden such as lady beetles  and wasps which feed on aphids. You can also wash them off with a strong spray,  or use an insecticidal soap. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Leafhoppers: </strong>Leafhoppers cause injury to leaves and  stunt growth. They also spread disease. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Remove plant  debris. Use insecticidal soaps. Consult your Cooperative Extension Service for  other insecticide recommendations. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Leafminers: </strong>These insects bore  just under the leaf surface causing irregular serpentine lines. The larvae are  yellow cylindrical maggots and the adults are small black and yellow flies.  They do not usually kill plants, but disfigure the foliage.<strong> <em>Burpee Recommends:  Remove affected foliage. Sanitation is important so be sure to remove all  debris at the end of the season.</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Lygus Bugs  (Tarnished Plant Bug):</strong> Lygus bugs are \u00bc inch long and are green or brown  with yellow markings. Nymphs are flightless and smaller than the adults. They  suck on stem tips and flower buds and inject a toxic that deforms roots, stems  and ruins flowers.\u00a0 <strong><em>Burpee  Recommends: Because lygus bugs over winter in garden debris, remove all debris  after the first frost. Contact your Cooperative Extension Service for  insecticide recommendations.</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Slugs: </strong>These  pests leave large holes in the foliage or eat leaves entirely. They leave a  slime trail, feed at night and are mostly a problem in damp weather.<strong> <em>Burpee  Recommends: Hand pick, at night if possible. You can try attracting the slugs  to traps either using cornmeal or beer. For a beer trap, dig a hole in the  ground and place a large cup or bowl into the hole; use something that has  steep sides so that the slugs can&rsquo;t crawl back out when they&rsquo;re finished. Fill  the bowl about \u00be of the way full with beer, and let it sit overnight. In the  morning, the bowl should be full of drowned slugs that can be dumped out for  the birds to eat. For a cornmeal trap, put a tablespoon or two of cornmeal in a  jar and put it on its side near the plants. Slugs are attracted to the scent but  they cannot digest it and it will kill them. You can also try placing a barrier  around your plants of diatomaceous earth or even coffee grounds. They cannot  crawl over these.</em></strong></p>'

          '<p><strong>What&rsquo;s the difference  between Swiss chard and rhubarb?</strong> These are completely different plants.  Sometimes Swiss chard is called rhubarb chard because the petioles look like  rhubarb. Swiss chard is an annual leafy crop and the leaves and petioles (leaf  stalks) may be eaten. Rhubarb is a perennial vegetable and the leaves are  poisonous; we only eat the petioles. <br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Can I grow Swiss  chard in containers?</strong> Yes, shorter varieties are fine for containers. Be  sure to use a commercial potting mix rather than garden soil. <br>\n  <strong><br>\n  What part of the Swiss  chard plant do we eat?</strong> We eat the leaves and stems, raw or cooked. <br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Can I start Swiss  chard early indoors?</strong> We recommend sowing directly in the garden as Swiss  chard grows quickly, but you can start indoors 6-8 weeks early if you wish. <br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Is Swiss chard a  perennial?</strong> Swiss chard is a biennial and can tolerate cold temperatures. If  you have a warm spell in winter you may be able to harvest some leaves. If it  survives the winter you can harvest in spring until it produces a flower stalk. </p>'

          "<p><strong><em>Common Disease Problems</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Anthracnose:</strong> This is a fungus disease that attacks  the fruit as it is ripening. The first visible sign is a circular spot on the  skin that is slightly sunken. The spots enlarge and turn black; the fruit rots.  Extended periods of heat and humidity facilitate anthracnose growth. The fungus  overwinters in diseased plant debris. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Plant resistant  varieties, provide sufficient space between plants for good air circulation,  avoid overhead watering which can spread the fungus spores, keep a clean  garden, remove and discard all diseased plant material and rotate crops. Use a  mulch to prevent spores from splashing from the soil onto plants.</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Bacterial Leaf Spot: </strong>First signs are small translucent spots with a broad yellowish edge that  slowly enlarge and become angular or irregularly circular with a reddish  center. It thrives in cooler temperatures. The disease may also affect and  disfigure flower heads.<strong> </strong><strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Remove infected plants. Rotate  crops with plants in a different family. Avoid overhead watering. Do not work around  plants when they are wet. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Root Knot Nematodes: </strong>Microscopic worm-like pests that cause swellings (galls) to form on  roots. Plants may wilt or appear stunted. This is a serious problem in many  Southern states. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Do  not plant into infested soil. Try planting &lsquo;Nema-Gone&rsquo; marigolds around your  plants. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Tobacco Mosaic Virus:</strong> The most characteristic sign of  virus is tight and dark green mottling of the leaves. Young leaves may be  bunched. Young plants may have a yellowish tone and become stunted. Fruit is  usually not affected in outward appearance, but it may be smaller and  scarcer.\u00a0 Leaflets may point upward and  have a grayish cast. <strong><em>Burpee  Recommends: </em></strong><strong><em>This disease is readily spread by handling. Destroy diseased plants and  the plants on either side. Never smoke in the garden as Tobacco Mosaic Virus  can be transmitted from a smoker's unwashed hands while handling plants.</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Wilt Diseases:</strong> Bacterial wilt is evidenced by rapid wilting and the death of the plant caused  by soil-borne bacteria. There is no forewarning of yellow or spotted leaves.  When the affected stem is cut near the soil line, the area is dark and oozes a  gray slime. The wilt does not attack the fruit. The bacteria live in the soil  and enter the plant through the roots. Control Measures: Do not grow plants in  the same family in that area or nearby for 4 or 5 years. Continue to apply  generous amounts of healthy compost to soil while fallow or support other  crops. Fusarium wilt is one of the most damaging tomato diseases because of its  spread during periods of hot weather. The first symptom of fusarium is the  appearance of a few yellow leaves or a slight drooping of the lower leaves.  Caused by a soil-borne fungus, the fungus enters through the roots and passes up  into the stem producing toxic substances. This fungus is similar to  verticillium wilt but will affect first onset side of the plant and then the  other. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Destroy  affected plants at the first sign of fusarium; rotate crops. </em></strong>Verticillium  wilt causes a wilting of the leaves and stems on several branches. Leaf margins  cup upward, leaves turn yellow and drop off. If fruit is produced, it is  usually smaller than normal. Like fusarium this will enter through the roots,  migrating up the stem and plugging a plant's transport vessels. It is  transmitted in the soil. It can also be spread by water and tools. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Practice at least a 4  year crop rotation. Remove and burn crop debris.</em></strong> Walnut Wilt causes  overall wilting of plants, or dwarfed growth, in close proximity to living  walnut tree. Some or all plants in a planting may be affected. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Do not plant tomatoes  near Black Walnut trees. These trees exude a toxin from their roots which kills  many plants. </em></strong><strong></strong><br>\n  <strong><em><br>\n  Common Pest and Cultural  Problems</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Aphids: </strong>Greenish, red, black or peach colored sucking  insects can spread disease as they feed on the undersides of leaves.

You can also wash them off with a strong spray,  or use an insecticidal soap. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Cutworms</strong>: These insects cut off the seedlings at the  soil level. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Place a paper cup collar (use a coffee cut  with the bottom cut out) around the base of the plant. They are usually mostly  a problem with young seedlings. You can also control by handpicking and  controlling weeds, where they lay their eggs. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Slugs: </strong>These  pests leave large holes in the foliage or eat leaves entirely. They leave a  slime trail, feed at night and are mostly a problem in damp weather.<strong> <em>Burpee  Recommends: Hand pick, at night if possible.

They may be red, black, brown or yellow. They  suck on the plant juices removing chlorophyll and injecting toxins which cause  white dots on the foliage. There is often webbing visible on the plant. They  cause the foliage to turn yellow and become dry and stippled. They multiply  quickly and thrive in dry conditions. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Spider mites may  be controlled with a forceful spray every other day. Try hot pepper wax or  insecticidal soap. Check with your Cooperative Extension Service for miticide  recommendations. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Whitefly: </strong>These are small  white flying insects that often rise up in a cloud when plants are disturbed or  brushed against.<strong> <em>Burpee Recommends: They are difficult to control without  chemicals.

Raise the lights as the plants grow taller.  Incandescent bulbs will not work for this process because they will get too  hot. Most plants require a dark period to grow, do not leave lights on for 24  hours.</li>\n  <li>Seedlings  do not need much fertilizer, feed when they are 3-4 weeks old using a starter  solution (half strength of a complete indoor houseplant food) according to  manufacturer&rsquo;s directions. </li>\n  <li>If  you are growing in small cells, you may need to transplant the seedlings to 3  or 4 inch pots when seedlings have at least 3 pairs of leaves before  transplanting to the garden so they have enough room to develop strong roots</li>\n  <li>Before  planting in the garden, seedling plants need to be &ldquo;hardened off&rdquo;. Accustom  young plants to outdoor conditions by moving them to a sheltered place outside  for a week. Be sure to protect them from wind and hot sun at first. If frost  threatens at night, cover or bring containers indoors, then take them out again  in the morning. This hardening off process toughens the plant&rsquo;s cell structure  and reduces transplant shock and scalding.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Planting  in the Garden:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Select  a location in full sun with good rich moist organic soil. Make sure you did not  grow tomatoes, peppers, eggplant or potatoes in the bed the previous year to  avoid disease problems.</li>\n  <li>Prepare  the bed by turning the soil under to a depth of 8 inches. Level with a rake to  remove clumps of grass and stones. </li>\n  <li>Tomatoes  should be set 30-48 inches apart in a row with the rows spaced 3-4 feet apart.  It can be tempting to space tomatoes more closely at planting time, but if you  plant too closely you will increase the chance of disease, and decrease yields. </li>\n  <li>Dig  a hole for each plant large enough to amply accommodate the root ball.\u00a0 </li>\n  <li>Carefully  remove the plant from its pot and gently loosen the root ball with your hands  to encourage good root development.\u00a0 </li>\n  <li>Tomatoes  can be planted deeply, with the stem buried to the first set of leaves. The  more deeply they are planted the more roots will form, providing the plant with  additional support and better ability to take up nutrients. Some gardeners  plant tomatoes by digging a horizontal trench and laying the plant in the  trench with the top 2-4 inches of the plant pointing upward. </li>\n  <li>Fill  the planting hole with soil to the top and press soil down firmly with your  hand leaving a slight depression around the plant to hold water.\u00a0 </li>\n  <li>Use  the plant tag as a location marker. This is particularly important if you are  trying different varieties. It is very difficult to tell which variety is which  from the foliage.\u00a0\u00a0 </li>\n  <li>Water  thoroughly, so that a puddle forms in the saucer you have created. This settles  the plants in, drives out air pockets and results in good root-to-soil contact.</li>\n  <li>Place  your plant support at this time. You can try tomato cages or staking.  Unsupported plants will sprawl on the ground, require no pruning, and will  probably produce a larger yield of smaller fruit than will staked plants. For  larger, cleaner, more perfect fruits, support plants as they grow. Growing on  stakes: Place strong stakes in the ground and set plants about 6 inches from  the stakes. Growing in cages: Place a cage around a single plant; let the vines  grow and enlarge within the cage, no pruning\u00a0  will be necessary.</li>\n</ul>'

          'How to Grow',
          "<ul>\n  <li>Keep  weeds under control during the growing season. Weeds compete with plants for  water, space and nutrients, so control them by either cultivating often or use  a mulch to prevent their seeds from germinating.\u00a0 </li>\n  <li>Mulches  also help retain soil moisture and maintain even soil temperatures. This is  especially important for tomatoes as their roots may be easily damaged when weeding,  and this can lead to blossom end rot. </li>\n  <li>Keep  plants well-watered during the growing season, especially during dry spells.  Plants need about 1-2 inches of rain per week during the growing season. Use a  rain gauge to check to see if you need to add water. It's best to water with a  drip or trickle system that delivers water at low pressure at the soil level.  If you water with overhead sprinklers, water early in the day so the foliage  has time to dry off before evening, to minimize disease problems. Keep the soil  moist but not saturated. </li>\n  <li>If  growing on stakes: As the plants grow, allow only one or two main stems to grow  and pinch out any other side shoots as they form. Gently tie the one or two  remaining shoots to the stake; don't pull them tightly against the stake. If  growing in cages, no pruning is necessary.</li>\n  <li>Whether  to remove the side shoots, or suckers, that grow out of the leaf axils or not  depends on the support system used. Gardeners using stakes usually snap off  these side shoots. They typically get earlier and larger tomatoes but overall  production tends to be less. If tomatoes are grown in cages, the suckers are  generally left on, although it's a good idea to pinch the tip out of them when  they are 6-8 inches long. Regardless you may want to remove all the growth from  the bottom 6-10 inches of the plant. This helps to improve air circulation and  reduce the spread of diseases such as early blight. Wait until the plants are  knee-high. In the morning when the plants have the most water in them, snap off  the lower growth while it is small. Any plants that look sick with distorted  foliage or have a mosaic pattern on the leaves should be removed as they may  have a virus that can spread to the other plants. It is best to do this early  in the season.</li>\n  <li>Monitor  for pests and diseases. Check with your local Cooperative Extension Service for  pest controls recommended for your area. </li>\n</ul>"

          'Common Pests and Problems',
          "<p><strong><em>Common Disease Problems</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Anthracnose:</strong> This is a fungus disease that attacks  the fruit as it is ripening. The first visible sign is a circular spot on the  skin that is slightly sunken. The spots enlarge and turn black; the fruit rots.  Extended periods of heat and humidity facilitate anthracnose growth. The fungus  overwinters in diseased plant debris. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Plant resistant  varieties, provide sufficient space between plants for good air circulation,  avoid overhead watering which can spread the fungus spores, keep a clean  garden, remove and discard all diseased plant material and rotate crops. Use a  mulch to prevent spores from splashing from the soil onto plants.</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Blight: </strong>Early  Blight is a very common disease which causes brown concentric rings to  appear on the lower leaves. The spots coalesce; the leaf turns brown and may  drop off the stem. Leaf drop moves up the stem. Fruit does not grow to full  size and is left exposed to possible sunburn/sunscald. This fungus overwinters  in plant debris and weeds. Late blight  is another fungus disease that causes defoliation and fruit rot. Greasy,  greenish-black, water soaked spots appear on the lower leaves. The spots  enlarge and if the weather is wet they will look mildewed. Fruits develop dark  rough spots. Rainy or cloudy days with temperatures of 70-80 degrees F and  nights at 40- 60 degrees F provide ideal conditions for the rapid growth of  this fungus. It is retarded by hot dry weather. The fungus is air-borne and can  spread from diseased plants growing nearby. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Practice  good garden hygiene at the end of the season and discard, do not compost,  possibly diseased plants. Space plants to allow for adequate air circulation.  Avoid overhead watering which may spread fungus spores. Plant in at least a 3  year rotation, do not alternate with plants in the same family (potatoes, peppers  or eggplants). Plant resistant varieties such as &lsquo;Cloudy Day&rsquo;.</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Septoria Leaf Spot: </strong>This disease<strong> </strong>causes severe losses in the Atlantic and  Central states. It is most severe during rainy seasons in closely planted  gardens. It usually appears when the plants begin to set fruit. Circular spots  with gray centers and dark margins appear on the lower older leaves. Fungus spores  are produced and darken the center of the spots. There is a progressive loss of  foliage and fruits suffer from sunscald.\u00a0 <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Remove and  destroy </em></strong><strong><em>Infected plant debris. Don't handle or brush against plants when they  are wet. Rotate plantings. Remove weeds growing nearby.</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Wilt Diseases:</strong> Bacterial wilt is evidenced by rapid wilting and the death of the plant caused  by soil-borne bacteria. There is no forewarning of yellow or spotted leaves.  When the affected stem is cut near the soil line, the area is dark and oozes a  gray slime. The wilt does not attack the fruit. The bacteria live in the soil  and enter the plant through the roots. Control Measures: Do not grow plants in  the same family in that area or nearby for 4 or 5 years. Continue to apply  generous amounts of healthy compost to soil while fallow or support other  crops. <strong>Fusarium</strong> wilt is one of the most damaging tomato diseases because  of its spread during periods of hot weather. The first symptom of fusarium is  the appearance of a few yellow leaves or a slight drooping of the lower leaves.  Caused by a soil-borne fungus, the fungus enters through the roots and passes up  into the stem producing toxic substances. This fungus is similar to  verticillium wilt but will affect first one side of the plant and then the  other. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Destroy  affected plants at the first sign of fusarium; rotate crops and plant resistant  varieties. </em>Verticillium</strong> wilt causes a wilting of the leaves and stems  on several branches. Leaf margins cup upward, leaves turn yellow and drop off.  If fruit is produced, it is usually smaller than normal. Like fusarium this  will enter through the roots, migrating up the stem and plugging a plant's  transport vessels. It is transmitted in the soil. It can also be spread by  water and tools. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends:  Practice at least a 4 year crop rotation. Remove and burn crop debris. Plant  resistant varieties.</em></strong> <strong>Walnut Wilt</strong> causes overall wilting of  plants, or dwarfed growth, in close proximity to living walnut tree. Some or  all plants in a planting may be affected. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Do not plant tomatoes near Black Walnut trees. These  trees exude a toxin from their roots which kills many plants. </em></strong><strong></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Virus (Various causes):</strong> The most characteristic sign  of virus is tight and dark green mottling of the leaves. Young leaves may be  bunched. Young plants may have a yellowish tone and become stunted. Fruit is  usually not affected in outward appearance, but it may be smaller and scarcer.  Leaflets may point upward and have a grayish cast. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: </em></strong><strong><em>Plant resistant varieties. This disease is  readily spread by handling. Destroy diseased plants and the plants on either  side. Never smoke in the garden as Tobacco Mosaic Virus can be transmitted from  a smoker's unwashed hands while handling plants.</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><em><br>\n  Common Pest and  Cultural Problems</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Aphids: </strong>Greenish, red, black or peach colored sucking  insects can spread disease as they feed on the undersides of leaves. They leave  a sticky residue on foliage that attracts ants. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends:  Introduce or attract natural predators into your garden such as lady beetles  and wasps who feed on aphids. You can also wash them off with a strong spray,  or use an insecticidal soap. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Blossom End Rot (BER): </strong>Blossom End Rot causes large brown or black dry or sunken spot(s) to  appear, usually starting at blossom end (opposite the stem) of the fruit.  Fruits often ripen prematurely. BER occurs when a plant cannot metabolize the  calcium it needs to develop properly. This can occur when there is not enough  calcium in the soil or when root damage and water stress reduce the uptake and  movement of calcium through a plant. Occasionally, BER is the result of  excessive nitrogen fertilization. It only takes a day for a lack of calcium to  affect fruit, and that day can occur any time after blossom set. </p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Once a  fruit has BER it will not recover. The plant is still healthy, just remove the  affected fruit from the plant. The fruit is still good to eat if you remove the  affected part. </li>\n  <li>BER  most frequently occurs on fruit produced earlier and later in the season as  this is when natural fluctuations in precipitation and cold weather occur.\u00a0 </li>\n  <li>To  avoid BER, properly site and prepare your garden bed before planting. Most  crops need full sun and loose, well-drained organic soil. Make sure soil pH is  slightly acidic, between 6.2 to 6.8, for optimum nutrient uptake. Test your  soil to see if calcium is recommended. If it is, apply lime in the recommended  quantity according to manufacturer's instructions.\u00a0 </li>\n  <li>Avoid  planting too early in cool soils as this can inhibit early root development,  making the plant more susceptible to BER. Start with a quality transplant: a  healthy seedling with strong roots will make a healthy plant. </li>\n  <li>Avoid  wide fluctuations in soil moisture by applying 2-3 inches of mulch. This will  moderate the release of water to plant roots, and also keep the soil from  drying out when it is directly exposed to the sun.\u00a0 </li>\n  <li>Avoid  drought stress by making sure your plants get at least 2 inches of rain or  water per week. Apply enough water to moisten more than the top inch of soil.  Container grown plants will need more than 2 inches of applied-water per week  in hot weather, check them daily if possible. Consider using drip irrigation or  soaker hoses. One or two soakings are better than many light waterings. </li>\n  <li>Avoid  over-fertilizing during the early fruiting stage, especially if the fertilizer  contains high percentages of nitrogen. Use fertilizers especially formulated  for tomatoes such as Tomato-tone. These fertilizers have just the right amount  of nitrogen and other micronutrients best for fruit production. </li>\n  <li>Avoid  close cultivation around the base of plants when weeding. A layer of mulch  should help prevent the possible disturbance or damage of fragile roots  accidentally.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Fruit Cracking: </strong>This indicates that when the fruit was  forming, it did not get an even supply of moisture from the roots. A sudden  rush of water from sudden and heavy summer rains through the stem can pop the  skin of a ripening fruit like an overfilled water balloon. The condition is  particularly pronounced after a drought when a summer storm delivers a great  amount of water to the tissues in the fruit. The skin cannot expand fast enough  and cracks appear. The crack may rupture allowing the entrance of blight and  rot. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Take care  with your watering: instead of a quick sprinkle every day, water deeply once or  twice a week (depending on rainfall) so the moisture soaks deeply into the soil  where roots can take it up as needed. Soaker hoses can help here. Stick your  finger into the soil every day to check that it is evenly moist a couple of  inches below the surface. Always mulch tomatoes to keep moisture from  evaporating, even in containers.\u00a0 </em></strong><strong></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Nematodes: </strong>Microscopic  worm-like pests that cause swellings (galls) to form on roots. Plants may wilt  or appear stunted. This is a serious problem in many Southern states. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: </em></strong><strong><em>Do  not plant into infested soil. Grow resistant varieties. Try planting &lsquo;Nema-Gone&rsquo;  marigolds around your plants. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Tomato Horn Worm: </strong>Large,  green caterpillars can quickly devour foliage<strong>. <em>Burpee Recommends: With  sturdy gloves on, hand pick and destroy them. HOWEVER if you see white  projections coming from the back of the caterpillar, do not destroy it. These  are the egg cases of a parasitic wasp that will destroy the caterpillar. These  wasps should be allowed to remain in your garden.</em></strong></p>"

          'FAQs',
          "<p><strong>Why do I have lots of leaves but no flowers? </strong>The  plant is likely getting too much nitrogen, which triggers it to grow foliage,  and not enough phosphorus, which favors flowering and fruiting. Choose a  fertilizer that has a balanced ratio of the three major elements, such as  10-10-10, or where the middle number (phosphorus) is larger than the first  number (nitrogen) such as 2-3-1. Tomatoes are heavy feeders and usually do need  fertilizer unless your soil is very rich. But follow manufacturer's directions  to avoid overdoing it.<br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Why do I have flowers but no fruit? </strong>Flowers are  aborting because of heat or cold or drought stress OR flowers are aborting  because of a lack of pollination OR the plant is not ready to set fruit and the  plant is self-aborting flowers to conserve and direct energy towards more  growth.<br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Why are my fruits malformed? </strong>There are multiple  causes for deformities but the two most common are catfacing and cracking. All  are cosmetic only, the fruits are still edible. No tomato crop will ever be  perfect. A certain amount of imperfection and loss is normal, though some years  are tougher on tomatoes than others. However, many diseases and cultural  reasons for misshapen tomatoes can be prevented. Properly choose, plant and  care for your tomatoes; and let last year's challenge inform how you grow this  year and this year's challenges inform how you grow next year. Bear in mind,  too, that many older varieties prized for their flavor, such as 'Brandywine',  are normally not perfectly red and round.<br>\n  <strong><br>\n  How do I grow tomatoes in a really hot climate? </strong>Tomatoes  perform best when temperatures are between 50 and 90 degrees F. In warmer  climates tomatoes cannot be grown in the heat of summer. Gardeners there grow  them during their mild winters. Some varieties are more heat resistant than  others: Arkansas Traveler; Heatwave II Hybrid; and Tasti-Lee.<br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Something is eating my tomatoes?!\u00a0 </strong>Squirrels, skunks, possums, voles, birds  and other small animals like tomatoes as much as people do. The only real way  to protect a tomato crop is with a physical barrier such as a sturdy chicken  wire or tomato cages. To be safe from diseases, discard animal-sampled  tomatoes.</p>"

          '<p><strong><em>Common Disease Problems</em></strong><br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Alternaria Leaf Spot: </strong>Small, round reddish brown spots, usually with a yellow halo, form on the  upper surface of the leaves. Severely infected leaves turn brown, curl upward,  wither and die. Fruit are not usually infected but can suffer from sunscald due  to leaf loss. This disease is worse in warm, wet or very humid weather.<strong> <em>Burpee  Recommends: Avoid getting water on the foliage. Remove infected plant parts and  do not work around wet plants. Provide plenty of air circulation. Contact your  Cooperative Extension Service for fungicide recommendations.</em></strong><br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Anthracnose:</strong> This is a fungus disease that attacks  the fruit as it is ripening. Irregular brown spots develop on the leaves.  Infected fruit develop sunken black spots that may have white mycelia during  wet weather. The spots enlarge and turn black; the fruit rots. Extended periods  of heat and humidity facilitate anthracnose growth. The fungus overwinters in  diseased plant debris. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Provide sufficient space  between plants for good air circulation, avoid overhead watering which can  spread the fungus spores, keep a clean garden, remove and discard all diseased  plant material and rotate crops.</em></strong><br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Bacterial Wilt:</strong> Leaves turn brown, stems wilt and shrivel, the infected plants die. <strong><em>Burpee  Recommends: Remove and destroy plants showing signs of the disease. Control  cucumber beetles, which spread the disease. Contact your Cooperative Extension  Service for recommendations. </em></strong><br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Powdery Mildew: </strong>This fungus disease occurs on the top of the leaves in humid weather  conditions. The leaves appear to have a whitish or greyish surface and may  curl.<strong> <em>Burpee Recommends: Avoid powdery mildew by providing good air  circulation for the plants by good spacing and pruning. Contact your  Cooperative Extension Service for fungicide recommendations. </em></strong><br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Seed Rot and Damping  Off: </strong>This is a fungus disease that affects seeds and seedlings. Infected  seeds will not spout. Infected seedlings can have brown thin stems and the  plants will quickly die. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Do not sow seeds until  the soil has warmed to 65 degrees. Plant seeds in a raised hill that will warm  up earlier. Keep beds moist but not water logged. </em></strong><br>\n</p>\n<p><strong><em>Common Pest and  Cultural Problems</em></strong><br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Aphids: </strong>Greenish, red, black or peach colored sucking  insects can spread disease as they feed on the undersides of leaves. They leave  a sticky residue on foliage that attracts ants. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends:  Introduce or attract natural predators into your garden such as lady beetles  and wasps which feed on aphids. You can also wash them off with a strong spray,  or use an insecticidal soap. </em></strong><br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Cucumber Beetles: </strong>Beetles<strong> </strong>may be spotted, striped or banded and can be very harmful.  Beetles are usually \u00bc to \u00bd inch in size. Beetles start feeding as soon as they  hatch and can kill or slow the growth of the plants. Beetle larva can also bore  through the roots of the plants. Beetles can also transmit diseases from plant  to plant. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Knock off  adults into a jar of soapy water and destroy them. Spade the soil to destroy  dormant beetles before you plant. Use a row cover to prevent adults from  feeding on young plants. Consult your  Cooperative Extension Service for insecticide recommendations. </em></strong><br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Fruit Splitting: </strong>This indicates that when the fruit was forming it did not get an even  supply of moisture from the roots. A sudden rush of water from sudden and heavy  summer rains through the stem can pop the skin of a ripening fruit like an  overfilled water balloon. The condition is particularly pronounced after a  drought when a summer storm delivers a great amount of water to the tissues in  the fruit. The skin cannot expand fast enough and splitting appears. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Take care with your  watering: instead of a quick sprinkle every day, water deeply once or twice a  week (depending on rainfall) so the moisture soaks deeply into the soil where  roots can take it up as needed. Soaker hoses can help. Stick your finger into  the soil every day to check that it is evenly moist a couple of inches below  the surface. </em></strong><br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Squash Bugs:</strong> Adults are 5/8 inch long and gray or  brown. Squash bugs give off a foul odor when crushed. Young nymphs have light  green abdomens and black heads and legs. As the nymphs grow they will change  color. Eggs are found in groups on the underside of leaves, eggs will be yellow  or brown. Squash bugs will feed on leaves and fruit.<strong><em> Burpee Recommends: Knock adults off into a jar of soapy water and  destroy them. Check for clusters of eggs on the back of leaves and destroy  them. Use a floating row cover to prevent females from laying eggs on plants.</em></strong><br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Spider Mites: </strong>These tiny spider-like pests are about  the size of a grain of pepper. They may be red, black, brown or yellow. They  suck on the plant juices removing chlorophyll and injecting toxins which cause  white dots on the foliage. There is often webbing visible on the plant. They  cause the foliage to turn yellow and become dry and stippled. They multiply  quickly and thrive in dry conditions. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Spider mites may  be controlled with a forceful spray every other day. Try hot pepper wax or  insecticidal soap. Check with your Cooperative Extension Service for miticide  recommendations. </em></strong><br>\n</p>'

          'FAQs',
          '<p><strong>Why does my fruit have  a bitter or poor flavor? </strong>Bitter flavor can be caused by a number of factors  including: hot and dry temperatures, overwatering, or poor soil fertilization.  Melons have shallow roots; make sure the soil is moist but never waterlogged.  Test your soil for nutrient deficiency.<br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Why do I have lots of leaves but no flowers? </strong>The  plant is likely getting too much nitrogen, which triggers it to grow foliage,  and not enough phosphorus, which favors flowering and fruiting. Choose a  fertilizer that has a balanced ratio of the three major elements, such as  10-10-10, or where the middle number (phosphorus) is larger than the first  number (nitrogen) such as 2-3-1. <br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Why do I have flowers but no fruit? </strong>\u00a0Cantaloupes  are &ldquo;Dioecious&rdquo;, meaning that they have both male and female flowers on the  same plant. Male flowers usually open first and female flowers have a baby  fruit behind the flower. Both<br>\ntypes of flowers must be present  to have fruit set.<strong> </strong>Flowers may abort because of heat or cold or  drought stress OR flowers abort because of a lack of pollination OR the plant  is not ready to set fruit and the plant is self-aborting flowers to conserve  and direct energy towards more growth.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>How  many melons per plant should I expect? </strong>Limit your fruit to 3-4 per plant. The more fruit  a vine supports, the smaller the fruit will be and the longer it will take to  ripen.<strong></strong><br>\n<br>\n<strong>Can  I ripen fruit off the vine? </strong>Regrettably,  no.\u00a0 Fruits are as ripe as they will ever  be the moment they are picked.\u00a0 <strong> </strong></p>'

          'Common Pests and Problems',
          '<p><strong><em>Common Disease Problems</em></strong><br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Damping Off: </strong>This is one of the most common problems when starting plants from seed. The seedling emerges and appears healthy; then it suddenly wilts and dies for no obvious reason. Damping off is caused by a fungus that is active when there is abundant moisture and soils and air temperatures are above 68 degrees F. Typically, this indicates that the soil is too wet or contains high amounts of nitrogen fertilizer. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Keep seedlings moist but do not overwater; avoid over-fertilizing your seedlings; thin out seedlings to avoid overcrowding; make sure the plants are getting good air circulation; if you plant in containers, thoroughly wash them in soapy water &amp; rinse in a ten per cent bleach solution after use.</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Nematodes: </strong>Microscopic worm-like pests that cause swellings (galls) to form on roots. Plants may wilt or appear stunted. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Do not plant into infested soil. Try planting &lsquo;Nema-Gone&rsquo; marigolds around your plants in the garden. Grow in containers.</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Powdery Mildew: </strong>This fungus disease occurs on the top of the leaves in humid weather conditions. The leaves appear to have a whitish or greyish surface and may curl.<strong> <em>Burpee Recommends: Avoid powdery mildew by providing good air circulation for the plants by good spacing and pruning. Contact your Cooperative Extension Service for fungicide recommendations. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Rust:</strong> A number of fungus diseases that cause rust colored spots on foliage. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Remove infected plants. Contact your Cooperative Extension Service for recommendations. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Smut: </strong>This fungus causes streaks on leaves that mature into black powdery spores. The fungus stunts the growth of the plants. The disease lives in the soil for several years. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Rotate crops and do not plant in the same area for at least three years. Encourage rapid growth with watering and fertilizer to get plants past the susceptible stage. Some fungicides are effective, Check with your Cooperative Extension Service for recommendations. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><em><br>\n  Common Pest and Cultural Problems</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Aphids: </strong>Greenish, red, black or peach colored sucking insects can spread disease as they feed on the undersides of leaves. They leave a sticky residue on foliage that attracts ants. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Introduce or attract natural predators into your garden such as lady beetles and wasps who feed on aphids. You can also wash them off with a strong spray, or use an insecticidal soap. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Armyworm</strong>: Holes in leaves can be singular or clumped together. Leaves can become skeletonized. Egg clusters may be evident on foliage with a cottony or fuzzy appearance. Young larvae are pale green and adults are darker with a light line along the side<strong> </strong>and pink underside. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Introduce natural enemies to the area.</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Slugs: </strong>These pests leave large holes in the foliage or eat leaves entirely. They leave a slime trail, feed at night and are mostly a problem in damp weather.<strong> <em>Burpee Recommends: Hand pick, at night if possible. You can try attracting the slugs to traps either using cornmeal or beer. For a beer trap, dig a hole in the ground and place a large cup or bowl into the hole; use something that has steep sides so that the slugs can&rsquo;t crawl back out when they&rsquo;re finished. Fill the bowl about \u00be of the way full with beer, and let it sit overnight. In the morning, the bowl should be full of drowned slugs that can be dumped out for the birds to eat. For a cornmeal trap, put a tablespoon or two of cornmeal in a jar and put it on its side near the plants. Slugs are attracted to the scent but they cannot digest it and it will kill them. You can also try placing a barrier around your plants of diatomaceous earth or even coffee grounds. They cannot crawl over these.</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Whitefly:\u00a0 </strong>These are small white flying insects that often rise up in a cloud when plants are disturbed or brushed against.<strong> <em>Burpee Recommends: They are difficult to control without chemicals. Try hot pepper wax or insecticidal soap. Check with your Cooperative Extension Service for pesticide recommendations. </em></strong><br>\n<strong><br>\nWireworms: </strong>These insects live in the soil and kill seedlings by girdling their stems at the soil line, bore into stems, roots and tubers. They may be found around the stems in the soil are and \u00bc to \u00be inch long, thin, yellow brown worms with a shiny skin. The adults are called click beetles, and are about 1/3 inch long, reddish brown with a hard shell. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Rotate crops. Check with your Cooperative Extension Service for pesticide recommendations which must be applied prior to planting.</em></strong></p>'

          '<p><strong><em>Common Disease Problems</em></strong><br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Botrytis Blight: </strong>This causes the older leaves and the center of the plant to rot. It can start with yellowish brown irregular spots on the leaves or water soaked spots on the stems. The fungus turns a fuzzy gray and emits a cloud of spores when touched.<strong> <em>Burpee Recommends: Remove infected plants and plant debris to avoid the spread of the disease and make sure plants have good air circulation. Keep organic mulches away from the plants as spores can live in the organic matter. Use pea gravel as mulches they will help decrease humidity around the plants. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Damping Off: </strong>This is one of the most common problems when starting plants from seed. The seedling emerges and appears healthy; then it suddenly wilts and dies for no obvious reason. Damping off is caused by a fungus that is active when there is abundant moisture and soils and air temperatures are above 68 degrees F. Typically, this indicates that the soil is too wet or contains high amounts of nitrogen fertilizer. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Keep seedlings moist but do not overwater; avoid over-fertilizing your seedlings; thin out seedlings to avoid overcrowding; make sure the plants are getting good air circulation; if you plant in containers, thoroughly wash them in soapy water and rinse in a ten per cent bleach solution after use.</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Powdery Mildew: </strong>This is a fungus disease that causes a white powdery look on the foliage. This disease weakens plants as it inhibits their ability to make carbohydrates for themselves using sunlight.<strong> <em>Burpee Recommends: You can remove infected plant areas, increase air circulation, and try to reduce the humidity in the room. Check with your Cooperative Extension Service for fungicide recommendations. </em></strong><br>\n<strong><br>\nRoot and Crown Rot: </strong>A number of diseases can cause root and stem rots. Symptoms include yellowing of the leaves, drying of the leaves and leaf tips, and whole branches may become brown and die. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Make sure the soil is very well drained and that the plant does not sit in water. Replace the soil with fresh potting mix for potted plants, after thoroughly cleaning the pot with a 10% bleach solution. Check with your Cooperative Extension Service for fungicide recommendations. </em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Common Pest and Cultural Problems</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Aphids: </strong>Greenish, red, black or peach colored sucking insects can spread disease as they feed on the undersides of leaves. They leave a sticky residue on foliage that attracts ants. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Introduce or attract natural predators into your garden such as lady beetles and wasps who feed on aphids. You can also wash them off with a strong spray, or use an insecticidal soap. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong>Leaves turn yellow or brown and may drop off: </strong>When the lower leaves turn yellow and the growth slows down this can indicate that the plant needs to be fertilized, or that it is rootbound. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: If the roots are circling around in the pot (rootbound), clip them and repot the plant. For a nutrient deficiency, use Garden-tone as directed on the packaging. </em></strong><strong></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Mealybugs</strong>: Flat wingless insects with a white waxy shell that form cottony looking masses on stems, branches and leaves. They suck the juices from leaves and stems and cause weak growth. They also attract ants with the honeydew they excrete, and the honeydew can grow a black sooty mold on it as well.<strong> <em>Burpee Recommends: Wash infected plant parts under the faucet and try to rub the bugs off. They may also be controlled by predator insects such as lacewings, ladybugs and parasitic wasps. Check with your Cooperative Extension Service for pesticide recommendations. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Scale: </strong>Insects similar to mealybugs, they feature a waxy outer shell and suck the juices from plant stems and leaves. They weaken the plants and make them more susceptible to other pests and diseases and environmental stress.<strong> <em>Burpee Recommends: If they are in the crawler stage (moving insects) they may be controlled with a cotton swab dipped in rubbing alcohol, or you may be able to scrape them off with your fingernail. Young plant parts that are infested may be removed. Check with your Cooperative Extension Service for pesticide recommendations such as horticultural oils. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Spider mites: </strong>These tiny spider-like pests are about the size of a grain of pepper. They may be red, black, brown or yellow. They suck on the plant juices removing chlorophyll and injecting toxins which cause white dots on the foliage. There is often webbing visible on the plant. They cause the foliage to turn yellow and become dry and stippled. They multiply quickly and thrive in dry conditions.<strong> <em>Burpee Recomends: They may be able to be controlled with a forceful spray every other day. Check with your Cooperative Extension Service for miticide recommendations. </em></strong></p>'

          'FAQs',
          '<p><strong>What is the difference between German and Roman chamomiles?\u00a0 </strong>They are not related botanically but both have fragrant ferny foliage and white daisy flowers, and both are used in potpourris. German is an annual plant which tends to readily self-sow while Roman is a perennial plant. Roman has a stronger apple fragrance and is a lower growing plant; it makes an excellent groundcover. German grows 2-3 feet tall and works well in flower beds.<br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Which chamomile is easier to grow?\u00a0 </strong>German chamomile is easy to start from seed; &lsquo;Flore Pleno&rsquo; chamomile is easier to grow-on from a pre-started plant. Both chamomile-types are easy to grow once established. <br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Can I grow chamomile in a container?</strong> Yes, German and Roman chamomiles are great for containers. <br>\n  <strong><br>\n  How can I use chamomile as a companion plant?</strong> Chamomile can help neighboring plants increase their essential oils and improve flavor and general health of the plants. It is particularly effective planted near members of the cabbage family, onions and mint. You can make a tea from a handful of flowers soaked in cold water for a day or two and use it to help sickly plants of young seedlings. <br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Which chamomile is used to make tea?</strong> Chamomile tea may be made from the flowers or either German or Roman chamomile. Chamomile is caffeine free and is often used as an herbal sleep aid. </p>'

Avoid overhead watering. Provide adequate air circulation, do not overcrowd plants. Do not work around plants when they are wet. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Powdery Mildew: </strong>This fungus disease occurs on the top of the leaves in humid weather conditions. The leaves appear to have a whitish or greyish surface and may curl.<strong> <em>Burpee Recommends: Avoid powdery mildew by providing good air circulation for the plants by good spacing and pruning. Contact your Cooperative Extension Service for fungicide recommendations. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong>Rust:</strong> A number of fungus diseases that cause rust colored spots on foliage and stems. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Practice crop rotation. Remove infected plants. Contact your Cooperative Extension Service for recommendations. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Sclerotinia: </strong>Also called white mold, this fungus looks like a spiderweb crawling on the surface of the growing medium. It can climb onto plants and kill them in time. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Decrease humidity and increase air circulation. Avoid overcrowding seedlings. Clean seed starting supplies thoroughly before reuse. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><em><br>\n  Common Pest and Cultural Problems</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Aphids: </strong>Greenish, red, black or peach colored sucking insects that can spread disease as they feed on the undersides of leaves.

You can try attracting the slugs to traps either using cornmeal or beer. For a beer trap, dig a hole in the ground and place a large cup or bowl into the hole; use something that has steep sides so that the slugs can&rsquo;t crawl back out when they&rsquo;re finished. Fill the bowl about \u00be of the way full with beer, and let it sit overnight. In the morning, the bowl should be full of drowned slugs that can be dumped out for the birds to eat. For a cornmeal trap, put a tablespoon or two of cornmeal in a jar and put it on its side near the plants. Slugs are attracted to the scent but they cannot digest it and it will kill them.

          '<p><strong>Can I plant chives indoors in containers?</strong> Yes, chives are ideal for indoor growing and container growing. Use a commercial potting mix rather than garden soil. <br>\n  <strong><br>\n  How to I know when I can harvest?</strong> Chives may be harvested any time once plants are established, usually about 80-90 days after plants sprout or are transplanted in the garden. <br>\n  <strong><br>\n  What&rsquo;s the difference between common chives and garlic chives?</strong> The plants are different species of the same genus. Garlic chives have broader leaves and a stronger flavor, midway between garlic and onions. <br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Can I use chives dried?</strong> Chives lose their flavor when dried. To save them for winter use try freezing them. <br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Can I use chives as companion plants?</strong> Yes, chives can help improve the flavor of tomatoes when planted as companions. They can help prevent black spot disease when planted at the base of rose plants and they can repel borers from fruit trees. They can improve the flavor of carrots and repel cucumber beetles and Japanese beetles. </p>'

          '<p><strong><em>Common Disease Problems</em></strong><br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Bacterial Leaf Spot: </strong>First signs are small translucent spots with a broad yellowish edge that slowly enlarge and become angular or irregularly circular with a reddish center. It thrives in cooler temperatures. The disease may also affect and disfigure flower heads.<strong> </strong><strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Remove infected plants. Rotate crops with plants in a different family. Avoid overhead watering. Do not work around plants when they are wet. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Botrytis Blight: </strong>Causes the older leaves and the center of the plant to rot. It can start with a yellowish brown irregular spots on the leaves or water soaked spots on the stems. The fungus turns a fuzzy gray and emits a cloud of spores when touched.<strong> <em>Burpee Recommends: Remove infected plants and plant debris to avoid the spread of the disease and make sure plants have good air circulation. Keep organic mulches away from the plants as spores can live in the organic matter. Use pea gravel as mulches they will help decrease humidity around the plants. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Damping Off: </strong>This is one of the most common problems when starting plants from seed. The seedling emerges and appears healthy; then it suddenly wilts and dies for no obvious reason. Damping off is caused by a fungus that is active when there is abundant moisture and soils and air temperatures are above 68 degrees F. Typically, this indicates that the soil is too wet or contains high amounts of nitrogen fertilizer. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Keep seedlings moist but do not overwater; avoid over-fertilizing your seedlings; thin out seedlings to avoid overcrowding; make sure the plants are getting good air circulation; if you plant in containers, thoroughly wash them in soapy water and rinse in a ten per cent bleach solution after use.</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Powdery Mildew: </strong>This is a fungus disease that causes a white powdery look on the foliage. This disease weakens plants as it inhibits their ability to make carbohydrates for themselves using sunlight.<strong> <em>Burpee Recommends: You can remove infected plant areas, increase air circulation, and try to reduce the humidity in the room. Check with your Cooperative Extension Service for fungicide recommendations. </em></strong><br>\n<strong><br>\nRoot Knot Nematodes: </strong>Microscopic worm-like pests that cause swellings (galls) to form on roots. Plants may wilt or appear stunted. This is a serious problem in many Southern states. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Do not plant into infested soil. Grow resistant varieties. Try planting &lsquo;Nema-Gone&rsquo; marigolds around your plants. </em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Common Pest and Cultural Problems</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Aphids: </strong>Greenish, red, black or peach colored sucking insects can spread disease as they feed on the undersides of leaves. They leave a sticky residue on foliage that attracts ants. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Introduce or attract natural predators into your garden such as lady beetles and wasps who feed on aphids. You can also wash them off with a strong spray, or use an insecticidal soap. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Cutworms</strong>: These insects cut off the seedlings at the soil level. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Place a paper cup collar (use a coffee cut with the bottom cut out) around the base of the plant. They are usually mostly a problem with young seedlings. You can also control by handpicking and controlling weeds, where they lay their eggs. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Deer: </strong>Plants may be eaten to the ground.<strong> <em>Burpee Recommends: Try a deer repellent or physical barrier for young plants. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Slugs: </strong>These pests leave large holes in the foliage or eat leaves entirely. They leave a slime trail, feed at night and are mostly a problem in damp weather.<strong> <em><br>\n  Burpee Recommends: Hand pick, at night if possible. You can try attracting the slugs to traps either using cornmeal or beer. For a beer trap, dig a hole in the ground and place a large cup or bowl into the hole; use something that has steep sides so that the slugs can&rsquo;t crawl back out when they&rsquo;re finished. Fill the bowl about \u00be of the way full with beer, and let it sit overnight. In the morning, the bowl should be full of drowned slugs that can be dumped out for the birds to eat. For a cornmeal trap, put a tablespoon or two of cornmeal in a jar and put it on its side near the plants. Slugs are attracted to the scent but they cannot digest it and it will kill them. You can also try placing a barrier around your plants of diatomaceous earth or even coffee grounds. They cannot crawl over these.</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Whitefly:\u00a0 </strong>These are small white flying insects that often rise up in a cloud when plants are disturbed or brushed against. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: They are difficult to control without chemicals. Try hot pepper wax or insecticidal soap.\u00a0 Check with your Cooperative Extension Service for pesticide recommendations. </em></strong></p>'

          '<p><strong><em>Common Disease Problems</em></strong><br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Cercospora Leaf Blight: </strong>Small flecks which develop a yellowish halo appear on the leaves and turn brown and coalesce. They cause the leaves to wither and die. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Remove infected plants and destroy all plant debris. Rotate crops.</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Damping Off: </strong>This is one of the most common problems when starting plants from seed. The seedling emerges and appears healthy; then it suddenly wilts and dies for no obvious reason. Damping off is caused by a fungus that is active when there is abundant moisture and soils and air temperatures are above 68 degrees F. Typically, this indicates that the soil is too wet or contains high amounts of nitrogen fertilizer. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Keep seedlings moist but do not overwater; avoid over-fertilizing your seedlings; thin out seedlings to avoid overcrowding; make sure the plants are getting good air circulation; if you plant in containers, thoroughly wash them in soapy water and rinse in a ten per cent bleach solution after use.</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Downy Mildew: </strong>This fungus causes yellow spots on the upper surface of the leaves, and whitish gray patches on the undersides and eventually both sides of the leaves. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Rotate crops with plants in a different family. Avoid overhead watering. Provide adequate air circulation, do not overcrowd plants. Do not work around plants when they are wet. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Powdery Mildew: </strong>This is a fungus disease that causes a white powdery look on the foliage. This disease weakens plants as it inhibits their ability to make carbohydrates for themselves using sunlight.<strong> <em>Burpee Recommends: You can remove infected plant areas, increase air circulation, and try to reduce the humidity in the room. Check with your Cooperative Extension Service for fungicide recommendations. </em></strong><br>\n<strong><br>\nRust: </strong>Lesions on the leaves are light green and become chlorotic. Yellow-orange pustules are seen on the underside of the leaves. Plants may become distorted. \u00a0<strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Check with your Cooperative Extension Service for fungicide recommendations. </em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Common Pest and Cultural Problems</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Aphids: </strong>Greenish, red, black or peach colored sucking insects can spread disease as they feed on the undersides of leaves. They leave a sticky residue on foliage that attracts ants. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Introduce or attract natural predators into your garden such as lady beetles and wasps who feed on aphids. You can also wash them off with a strong spray, or use an insecticidal soap. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Armyworm</strong>: Holes in leaves can be singular or clumped together. Leaves can become skeletonized. Egg clusters may be evident on foliage with a cottony or fuzzy appearance. Young larvae are pale green and adults are darker with a light line along the side<strong> </strong>and pink underside. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Introduce natural enemies to the area.</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Cutworms</strong>: These insects cut off the seedlings at the soil level. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Place a paper cup collar (use a coffee cut with the bottom cut out) around the base of the plant. They are usually mostly a problem with young seedlings. You can also control by handpicking and controlling weeds, where they lay their eggs. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Slugs: </strong>These pests leave large holes in the foliage or eat leaves entirely. They leave a slime trail, feed at night and are mostly a problem in damp weather.<strong> <em>Burpee Recommends: Hand pick, at night if possible. You can try attracting the slugs to traps either using cornmeal or beer. For a beer trap, dig a hole in the ground and place a large cup or bowl into the hole; use something that has steep sides so that the slugs can&rsquo;t crawl back out when they&rsquo;re finished. Fill the bowl about \u00be of the way full with beer, and let it sit overnight. In the morning, the bowl should be full of drowned slugs that can be dumped out for the birds to eat. For a cornmeal trap, put a tablespoon or two of cornmeal in a jar and put it on its side near the plants. Slugs are attracted to the scent but they cannot digest it and it will kill them. You can also try placing a barrier around your plants of diatomaceous earth or even coffee grounds. They cannot crawl over these.</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Whitefly:\u00a0 </strong>These are small white flying insects that often rise up in a cloud when plants are disturbed or brushed against.<strong> <em>Burpee Recommends: They are difficult to control without chemicals. Try hot pepper wax or insecticidal soap. Check with your Cooperative Extension Service for pesticide recommendations. </em></strong></p>'

          '<p><strong>Should I eat fennel raw or cooked? </strong>Many parts of the fennel plant may be eaten, including bulb, stalks, leaves and seeds. You can cook the bulbs and stalks, use seeds in cooking and use the leaves in cooking. Leaves, stalks and bulbs may also be used raw. <br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Can I grow fennel in a container?</strong> Fennel can grow large, although &lsquo;Orion&rsquo; is a smaller more compact variety. If growing fennel in a container use an 18-24 inch container and be sure to use a commercial potting mix rather than garden soil. <br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Can I use fennel as a companion plant? </strong>Fennel attracts beneficial insects to the garden. Otherwise is not is commonly used as a companion plant and may inhibit the growth of neighboring plants. <br>\n  <strong><br>\n  What do I do if I see caterpillars?? </strong>Fennel is a host plant to black swallowtail butterflies, so the caterpillars are a good thing in your garden. <br>\n  <strong>I had fennel last year and it seems to be coming back, does fennel self sow? </strong>Yes, fennel is a short lived perennial plant and does tend to self sow where it is happy. </p>'

          '<p><strong><em>Common Disease Problems</em></strong><br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Botrytis Blight: </strong>Also called gray mold, this causes a brown to gray fungus on plant leaves and stems. Diseased leaves die and fall off. If the infection is severe on the main stem the plant may die. The condition thrives in high humidity and cooler temperatures. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Remove infected plants and plant debris and clean tools before working with plants to avoid the spread of the disease and make sure plants have good air circulation. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Damping Off: </strong>This is one of the most common problems when starting plants from seed. The seedling emerges and appears healthy; then it suddenly wilts and dies for no obvious reason. Damping off is caused by a fungus that is active when there is abundant moisture and soils and air temperatures are above 68 degrees F. Typically, this indicates that the soil is too wet or contains high amounts of nitrogen fertilizer. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Keep seedlings moist but do not overwater; avoid over-fertilizing your seedlings; thin out seedlings to avoid overcrowding; make sure the plants are getting good air circulation; if you plant in containers, thoroughly wash them in soapy water and rinse in a ten per cent bleach solution after use.</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Downy Mildew: </strong>This fungus causes whitish grey patches on the undersides and eventually both sides of the leaves. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Rotate crops with plants in a different family. Avoid overhead watering. Provide adequate air circulation, do not overcrowd plants. Do not work around plants when they are wet. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Powdery Mildew: </strong>This fungus disease occurs on the top of the leaves in humid weather conditions. The leaves appear to have a whitish or greyish surface and may curl.<strong> <em>Burpee Recommends: Avoid powdery mildew by providing good air circulation for the plants by good spacing and pruning. Contact your Cooperative Extension Service for fungicide recommendations. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Rust:</strong> A number of fungus diseases that rust colored spots on foliage. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Plant early as these diseases tend to be worse later in the season. Practice crop rotation. Remove infected plants. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><em><br>\n  Common Pest and Cultural Problems</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Aphids: </strong>Greenish, red, black or peach colored sucking insects that can spread disease as they feed on the undersides of leaves.

You can also wash them off with a strong spray, or use an insecticidal soap. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Cutworms</strong>: These insects cut off the seedlings at the soil level. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Place a paper cup collar (use a coffee cut with the bottom cut out) around the base of the plant. They are usually mostly a problem with young seedlings. You can also control by handpicking and controlling weeds, where they lay their eggs. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Mealybugs</strong>: Mealybugs are 1/8 to \u00bc inch long flat wingless insects that secrete a white powder that forms a waxy shell that protects them. They form cottony looking masses on stems, branches and leaves. They suck the juices from leaves and stems and cause weak growth. They also attract ants with the honeydew they excrete, and the honeydew can grow a black sooty mold on it as well.<strong> <em>Burpee Recommends: Wash infected plant parts under the faucet and try to rub the bugs off.

          '<p><strong><em>Common Disease Problems</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Anthracnose: </strong>Small water soaked spots on leaves and stems.<strong> <em>Burpee Recommends: Avoid planting in the same location in the future, planting in containers can help. Prune plants to the ground in the fall. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Damping Off: </strong>This is one of the most common problems when starting plants from seed. The seedling emerges and appears healthy; then it suddenly wilts and dies for no obvious reason. Damping off is caused by a fungus that is active when there is abundant moisture and soils and air temperatures are above 68 degrees F. Typically, this indicates that the soil is too wet or contains high amounts of nitrogen fertilizer. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Keep seedlings moist but do not overwater; avoid over-fertilizing your seedlings; thin out seedlings to avoid overcrowding; make sure the plants are getting good air circulation; if you plant in containers, thoroughly wash them in soapy water and rinse in a ten per cent bleach solution after use.</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Mint Rust: </strong>Small, whitish, slightly raised spots that turn reddish orange or brown. This occurs on the underside of the leaves. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Avoid overhead irrigation systems. Water early so the leaves have the whole day to dry out. Do not plant members of the mint family in the same location. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Powdery Mildew: </strong>This fungus disease occurs on the top of the leaves in humid weather conditions. The leaves appear to have a whitish or greyish surface and may curl.<strong> <em>Burpee Recommends: Avoid powdery mildew by providing good air circulation for the plants by good spacing and pruning. Contact your Cooperative Extension Service for fungicide recommendations. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Verticillium Wilt: </strong>Yellows begin turning yellow starting at the margin. Eventually, leaves will curl and die. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Rotate plantings, remove infected plants, do not over fertilize.</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Common Pest and Cultural Problems</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Aphids: </strong>Greenish, red, black or peach colored sucking insects that can spread disease as they feed on the undersides of leaves. They leave a sticky residue on foliage that attracts ants. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Introduce or attract natural predators into your garden such as lady beetles and wasps who feed on aphids. You can also wash them off with a strong spray, or use an insecticidal soap. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Cutworms</strong>: These insects cut off the seedlings at the soil level. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Place a paper cup collar (use a coffee cut with the bottom cut out) around the base of the plant. They are usually mostly a problem with young seedlings. You can also control by handpicking and controlling weeds, where they lay their eggs. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Flea Beetles: </strong>These small hopping beetles feed on plant foliage and spread diseases. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Rotate crops with plants in a different plant family. Use floating row covers to prevent damage to young foliage.</em></strong> <br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Spider Mites: </strong>These tiny spider-like pests are about the size of a grain of pepper. They may be red, black, brown or yellow. They suck on the plant juices removing chlorophyll and injecting toxins which cause white dots on the foliage. There is often webbing visible on the plant. They cause the foliage to turn yellow and become dry and stippled. They multiply quickly and thrive in dry conditions. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Spider mites may be controlled with a forceful spray every other day. Try hot pepper wax or insecticidal soap. Check with your Cooperative Extension Service for miticide recommendations. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Thrips: </strong>Thrips are tiny needle-thin insects that are black or straw colored. They suck the juices of plants and attack flower petals, leaves and stems. The plant will have a stippling, discolored flecking or silvering of the leaf surface. Thrips can spread many diseases from plant to plant. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Many thrips may be repelled by sheets of aluminum foil spread between rows of plants. Remove weeds from the bed and remove debris from the bed after frost. Check with your Cooperative Extension Service for pest controls. </em></strong></p>'

          'FAQs',
          '<p><strong>Can I grow mint indoors during the winter?</strong> Yes mint is fine for indoor growing, as long as you have plenty of light. <br>\n  <strong><br>\n  How can I prevent my mint from spreading throughout the garden?</strong> It is best to contain it somehow, either by planting in containers or raised beds, or sinking a barrier around the plant in the soil. <br>\n  <strong><br>\n  How can mint be used as a companion plant?</strong> Mint can be planted as a companion to plants in the cabbage family as it can deter pests. It can benefit carrots as it deters carrot root fly. It is good to plant with onions, radishes and tomatoes as it deters insects that attack those plants. Mint also repels fleas, flies and ants. <br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Is mint easy to grow from seed?</strong> Mint can actually be challenging to grow from seed, but is extremely easy to grow from plants. <br>\n  <strong><br>\n  I brought my mint plant indoors and all the leaves are drying up. What happened?</strong> It is possible that the plant is experiencing transplant shock from the very different outdoor and indoor growing conditions. Try to acclimate your plants slowly when bringing them inside or outside at the changing of seasons. Indoor conditions are usually much drier that outdoor so keep the humidity level higher by placing your container on a tray of pebbles. Also make sure your plants are getting sufficient light as light conditions tend to be weaker indoors. For the plant you have, try cutting back any dead growth and it may grow from the stems or roots. </p>'

          '<p><strong>Can I grow thyme indoors?</strong> Yes, thyme is fine grown indoors in a sunny location. <br>\n  <strong><br>\n  How can I use thyme as a companion plant? </strong>Plant thyme near members of the cabbage family to deter insects that attack those plants. Thyme also may be planted as a companion to eggplant, onion, potato, sage and tomato, improving the flavor and vigor and deterring insects.<br>\n  <strong><br>\n  My thyme is getting woody, how can I rejuvenate it? </strong>Cut out any dead or damaged stems in late winter or early spring. In summer, trim the plant back by one third of its height if it looks leggy. Cut back overgrown stems to the desired height to keep a mounded shape. <br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Are thyme flowers edible?</strong> Yes thyme flowers are edible and may be scattered on salads, or added to teas.<br>\n  <strong><br>\n  How can I make a thyme topiary? </strong>Prune the side shoots to encourage vertical growth. Stake the plant and hold it to the stake with soft ties. Let it grow in full sun with plenty of water and when the plant is about 2 feet tall, snip the tops to encourage side shoots. Strip the bottom two thirds of the stem of the branches and leave the top third for shaping. Continue to pinch off the growing tips to maintain a full dense top.<strong></strong></p>'

          'Common Pests and Problems',
          '<p><strong><em>Common Disease Problems</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Alternaria Leaf Spot</strong><strong>: </strong>Small, round reddish brown spots with white to gray centers form on the upper surface of the leaves. The lesions may encircle the stems and cause wilt. This disease is worse in warm, wet or very humid weather.<strong> <em>Burpee Recommends: Avoid getting water on the foliage. Remove infected plant parts and do not work around wet plants. Provide plenty of air circulation. Contact your Cooperative Extension Service for fungicide recommendations.</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Cercospora Leaf Blight: </strong>Small flecks which develop a yellowish halo appear on the leaves and turn brown and coalesce. They cause the leaves to wither and die. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Remove infected plants and destroy all plant debris. Rotate crops.</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Damping Off: </strong>This is one of the most common problems when starting plants from seed. The seedling emerges and appears healthy; then it suddenly wilts and dies for no obvious reason. Damping off is caused by a fungus that is active when there is abundant moisture and soils and air temperatures are above 68 degrees F. Typically, this indicates that the soil is too wet or contains high amounts of nitrogen fertilizer. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Keep seedlings moist but do not overwater; avoid over-fertilizing your seedlings; thin out seedlings to avoid overcrowding; make sure the plants are getting good air circulation; if you plant in containers, thoroughly wash them in soapy water and rinse in a ten per cent bleach solution after use.</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Powdery Mildew </strong>occurs on the top of the leaves in humid weather conditions. The leaves appear to have a whitish or greyish surface and may curl.<strong> <em>Burpee Recommends:\u00a0 Avoid powdery mildew by providing good air circulation for the plants by good spacing and pruning. Contact your Cooperative Extension Service for fungicide recommendations. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Septoria leaf spot: </strong>Small, angular, gray-brown spots appear on leaves. Spots have defined red margins. Black fruiting bodies may be visible. Leaves will eventually become chlorotic or necrotic.<strong> <em>Burpee Recommends: Rotate crops, avoid overhead watering. Plant to allow for good air circulation and keep weed free. Remove and destroy affected foliage.</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Common Pest and Cultural Problems</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Aphids: </strong>Greenish, red, black or peach colored sucking insects can spread disease as they feed on the undersides of leaves. They leave a sticky residue on foliage that attracts ants. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Introduce or attract natural predators into your garden such as lady beetles and wasps who feed on aphids. You can also wash them off with a strong spray, or use an insecticidal soap. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Armyworm</strong>: Holes in leaves can be singular or clumped together. Leaves can become skeletonized. Egg clusters may be evident on foliage with a cottony or fuzzy appearance. Young larvae are pale green and adults are darker with a light line along the side<strong> </strong>and pink underside. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Introduce natural enemies to the area.</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Cutworms</strong>: These insects cut off the seedlings at the soil level. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Place a paper cup collar (use a coffee cut with the bottom cut out) around the base of the plant. They are usually mostly a problem with young seedlings. You can also control by handpicking and controlling weeds, where they lay their eggs. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Leafhoppers: </strong>Leafhoppers cause injury to leaves and stunt growth. They also spread disease. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Remove plant debris. Use insecticidal soaps. Consult your Cooperative Extension Service for other insecticide recommendations. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Parsley Worms: </strong>These colorful yellowish-greenish caterpillars with dotted black stripes can grow 2 inches long, will turn into black swallowtail butterflies. They feed on the foliage of parsley, carrots and dill. Burpee Recommends: Handpick. <strong><em>Consult your Cooperative Extension Service for other insecticide recommendations. There is no need to destroy all of these worms as they do not do a great deal of damage, and they turn into important pollinators for your garden.</em></strong></p>'

          '<p><strong>Can I grow parsley indoors? </strong>Yes if you have a sunny location, you can grow parsley indoors. Parsley is also great for containers, adding interesting textures to mixed plantings. <br>\n  <strong><br>\n  How can I use parsley as a companion plant?</strong> Parsley can deter beetles from asparagus patches. It can also help tomatoes by deterring insects and improving the flavor. <br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Is parsley an annual or perennial? </strong>Parsley is a biennial. It is grown as an annual in most gardens because it is grown for the foliage which may be harvested the first year. It can tolerate frost, but tends to become more bitter the second year.<br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Why does my parsley taste bitter?</strong> The second year parsley will produce a flower stalk and at that time the foliage can taste bitter. You can keep the plant blooming to save the seed, but otherwise remove it at this time. <br>\n  <strong><br>\n  When should I add parsley to my cooking?</strong> Parsley is a delicate herb and should only be added at the end of cooking, in the last minute or two, or used as a garnish. </p>'

          '<p><strong>Every year I bring a rosemary plant inside in the fall and every year it dies in a few weeks. What am I doing wrong?\u00a0 </strong>Rosemary often has a tough time adapting to indoor growing conditions after being outside. It is often much drier indoors than people realize when they start heating their homes in fall, and the plants also require full sun. Rosemary can benefit from a light misting when grown in doors, and be sure that the pot has excellent drainage. Also, do not allow the plant to dry out, but also do not allow it to sit in water. Place the pot on a tray of moistened pebbles.<br>\n  <strong><br>\n  I harvested rosemary leaves and tried cooking with them but they were all woody. What did I do wrong?\u00a0 </strong>Always chop up your rosemary leaves before using them as flavoring or they will taste woody. <br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Are rosemary flowers edible? </strong>Yes they are! Remove the flower and you can scatter the petals on salads or appetizers. <br>\n  <strong><br>\n  When should I add rosemary to my cooking? </strong>Rosemary can be added early in the cooking process, at least twenty minutes before the food is ready. <br>\n  <strong><br>\n  How can I turn my rosemary into a topiary plant</strong>? Prune the side shoots to encourage vertical growth. Stake the plant and hold it to the stake with soft ties. Let it grow in full sun with plenty of water and when the plant is about 2 feet tall, snip the tops to encourage side shoots. Strip the bottom two thirds of the stem of the branches and leave the top third for shaping. Continue to pinch off the growing tips to maintain a full dense top.</p>\n</body>'

          '<p><strong><em>Common Disease Problems</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Alternaria Leaf Spot</strong><strong>: </strong>Small, round reddish brown spots with white to gray centers form on the upper surface of the leaves. The lesions may encircle the stems and cause wilt. This disease is worse in warm, wet or very humid weather.<strong> <em>Burpee Recommends: Avoid getting water on the foliage. Remove infected plant parts and do not work around wet plants. Provide plenty of air circulation. Contact your Cooperative Extension Service for fungicide recommendations.</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Damping Off: </strong>This is one of the most common problems when starting plants from seed. The seedling emerges and appears healthy; then it suddenly wilts and dies for no obvious reason. Damping off is caused by a fungus that is active when there is abundant moisture and soils and air temperatures are above 68 degrees F. Typically, this indicates that the soil is too wet or contains high amounts of nitrogen fertilizer. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Keep seedlings moist but do not overwater; avoid over-fertilizing your seedlings; thin out seedlings to avoid overcrowding; make sure the plants are getting good air circulation; if you plant in containers, thoroughly wash them in soapy water and rinse in a ten per cent bleach solution after use.</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Mint Rust: </strong>Small, whitish, slightly raised spots that turn reddish orange or brown. This occurs on the underside of the leaves. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Avoid overhead irrigation systems. Water early so the leaves have the whole day to dry out. Do not plant members of the mint family in the same location. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Powdery Mildew </strong>occurs on the top of the leaves in humid weather conditions. The leaves appear to have a whitish or greyish surface and may curl.<strong> <em>Burpee <br>\n  Recommends:\u00a0 Avoid powdery mildew by providing good air circulation for the plants by good spacing and pruning. Contact your Cooperative Extension Service for fungicide recommendations. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong>Septoria Leaf Spot: </strong>Small, angular, gray-brown spots. Spots have defined red margins. Black fruiting bodies may be visible. Leaves will eventually become chlorotic or necrotic.<strong> <em>Burpee Recommends: Rotate crops, avoid overhead watering. Plant to allow for air circulation. \u00a0</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>Common Pest and Cultural Problems</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Aphids: </strong>Greenish, red, black or peach colored sucking insects can spread disease as they feed on the undersides of leaves. They leave a sticky residue on foliage that attracts ants. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Introduce or attract natural predators into your garden such as lady beetles and wasps who feed on aphids. You can also wash them off with a strong spray, or use an insecticidal soap. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Slugs: </strong>These pests leave large holes in the foliage or eat leaves entirely. They leave a slime trail, feed at night and are mostly a problem in damp weather.<strong> <em>Burpee Recommends: Hand pick, at night if possible. You can try attracting the slugs to traps either using cornmeal or beer. For a beer trap, dig a hole in the ground and place a large cup or bowl into the hole; use something that has steep sides so that the slugs can&rsquo;t crawl back out when they&rsquo;re finished. Fill the bowl about \u00be of the way full with beer, and let it sit overnight. In the morning, the bowl should be full of drowned slugs that can be dumped out for the birds to eat. For a cornmeal trap, put a tablespoon or two of cornmeal in a jar and put it on its side near the plants. Slugs are attracted to the scent but they cannot digest it and it will kill them. You can also try placing a barrier around your plants of diatomaceous earth or even coffee grounds. They cannot crawl over these.</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Spider Mites: </strong>These tiny spider-like pests are about the size of a grain of pepper. They may be red, black, brown or yellow. They suck on the plant juices removing chlorophyll and injecting toxins which cause white dots on the foliage. There is often webbing visible on the plant. They cause the foliage to turn yellow and become dry and stippled. They multiply quickly and thrive in dry conditions. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Spider mites may be controlled with a forceful spray every other day. Try hot pepper wax or insecticidal soap. Check with your Cooperative Extension Service for miticide recommendations. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Spittlebugs: </strong>These hopping insects protect themselves from predators with a white foam while the young insects feed on the leaves and stems. When the insects emerge they are hoppers with large &quot;froggy&quot; eyes. There is only one generation each year but the larvae can hatch over a period of several weeks as the eggs were laid in the fall.<strong> <em>Burpee Recommends: To control wash the foam off with a strong water spray. This will usually also kill the larvae. Do this once or twice a week for as long as needed. The damage is usually minimal. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Thrips: </strong>Thrips are tiny needle-thin insects that are black or straw colored. They suck the juices of plants and attack flower petals, leaves and stems. The plant will have a stippling, discolored flecking or silvering of the leaf surface. Thrips can spread many diseases from plant to plant. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Many thrips may be repelled by sheets of aluminum foil spread between rows of plants. Remove weeds from the bed and remove debris from the bed after frost. Check with your Cooperative Extension Service for pest controls. </em></strong></p>'

          'FAQs',
          '<p><strong>Can I grow sage indoors? </strong>Yes, sage may be grown indoors in a sunny location for winter use. <br>\n  <strong><br>\n  How can I use sage as a companion plant?</strong> Sage can benefit members of the cabbage family by deterring insects. Sage also helps control carrot fly and so can help carrots. Plant with strawberries and tomatoes to improve their flavor. <br>\n  <strong><br>\n  How can I keep my sage from getting leggy?</strong> Sage will grow leggy if it does not have enough sun, it requires at least 6 hours of sun per day. To encourage a bushier plant pinch sage as it grows in spring. <br>\n  <strong><br>\n  When should I add sage to my cooking?</strong> Sage is not a delicate herb and should be added dry twenty minutes before the cooking is finished. <br>\n  <strong><br>\n  My sage is getting woody, what can I do to rejuvenate it?</strong> Sage will grow woody in age and may be rejuvenated by dividing the plant in spring and using the newer part of the plant, discarding the old crown. You can also take cuttings in early summer and root them. </p>'

          '<p><strong>Is stevia challenging to grow from seed?</strong> Yes, stevia can be challenging to grow from seed. This is because it tends to have a low germination rate and it germinates slowly. It is much easier to grow from transplanted plants. <br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Can I leave stevia in my garden over the winter? </strong>Stevia is a tropical plant and cannot survive cold temperatures. It will survive for a few years in areas with warm winters. <br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Can I bring my stevia inside for the winter?</strong> You can bring it inside and grow it in a sunny location. The plants get rather large, we would recommend cutting it back when you bring it in to rejuvenate it. <br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Are the flowers edible?</strong> Stevia is grown for its sweet leaves rather than flowers, and the leaves should be harvested before flowering for the best sweetness. If you allow the plant to flower, you can save the seeds for reuse, or use them as cut flowers. <br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Is stevia related to sugarcane?</strong> No, stevia is a South American native related to sunflowers and asters. It does not contain sugar, but its crushed leaves taste much sweeter than sugar without the calories.</p>\n</body>'

Plants need about 1 inch of rain per week during the growing season. Use a rain gauge to check to see if you need to add water. It&rsquo;s best to water with a drip or trickle system that delivers water at low pressure at the soil level. If you water with overhead sprinklers, water early in the day so the foliage has time to dry off before evening, to minimize disease problems.

          '<ul>\n  <li>Sweet marigold, also called Mexican mint or Spanish tarragon, is used as a tarragon substitute in warmer climates where tarragon does not grow well. Use fresh or dried leaves in cooking chicken, seafood and hearty vegetable dishes. </li>\n  <li>Harvest leaves and flowers as needed throughout the season. Harvest leaves just before flowering, harvest flowers for potpourri.</li>\n  <li>To dry leaves, tie the stems together and hang upside down in a dark, airy room. It can help to secure a paper bag over the lower part of the plants with a rubber band to prevent loss of leaves and protect them from the sun. Poke small holes in the bag for air circulation. Check after four or five days. Or, use a dehydrator following the manufacturer&rsquo;s instructions. When thoroughly dry, store leaves and flowers in a tightly sealed glass jar in a dry, dark location, such as a cupboard.</li>\n  <li>If storing seeds, store in tightly closed containers.</li>\n</ul>'

          'Common Pests and Problems',
          "<p><strong><em>Common Disease Problems</em></strong><br>\n  <br>\n  <strong>Alternaria Leaf Spot: </strong>Small, round reddish brown spots with white to gray centers form on the upper surface of the leaves. The lesions may encircle the stems and cause wilt. This disease is worse in warm, wet or very humid weather.<strong> <em>Burpee Recommends: Avoid getting water on the foliage. Remove infected plant parts and do not work around wet plants. Provide plenty of air circulation. Contact your Cooperative Extension Service for fungicide recommendations.</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Aster Yellows: </strong>Plants are stunted, develop witch's brooms (excessive growth), petals turn green and become deformed. This virus-like condition is spread by leafhoppers.<strong> <em>Burpee Recommends: Remove infected plants and control leafhoppers. Remove weeds in the area which serve as alternate hosts to the disease. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Botrytis: </strong>This fungus causes a grey mold on flowers, leaves, stems and buds. It thrives in cool wet weather conditions. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Remove affected plant parts, avoid watering at night and getting water on the plant when watering. Make sure plants have good air circulation. Contact your Cooperative Extension Service for fungicide recommendations. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Damping Off: </strong>This is one of the most common problems when starting plants from seed. The seed emerges and appears healthy; then it suddenly wilts and dies for no obvious reason. Damping off is caused by a fungus that is active when there is abundant moisture and soils and air temperatures are above 68 degrees F. Typically, this indicates that the soil is too wet or contains high amounts of nitrogen fertilizer. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Keep seedlings moist but do not overwater; avoid over-fertilizing your seedlings; thin out seedlings to avoid overcrowding; make sure the plants are getting good air circulation; if you plant in containers, thoroughly wash them in soapy water and rinse in a ten per cent bleach solution after use.</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Verticillium Wilt:</strong> causes a wilting of the leaves and stems on several branches. Leaf margins cup upward, leaves turn yellow and drop off. This will enter through the roots, migrating up the stem and plugging a plant's transport vessels. It is transmitted in the soil. It can also be spread by water and tools. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Practice at least a 4 year crop rotation. Remove and burn crop debris. </em></strong><strong></strong><br>\n  <strong><em>Common Pest and Cultural Problems</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Aphids: </strong>Greenish, red, black or peach colored sucking insects can spread disease as they feed on the undersides of leaves. They leave a sticky residue on foliage that attracts ants. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Introduce or attract natural predators into your garden such as lady beetles and wasps who feed on aphids. You can also wash them off with a strong spray, or use an insecticidal soap. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Leafhoppers: </strong>Leafhoppers cause injury to leaves and stunt growth. They also spread disease. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Remove plant debris. Use insecticidal soaps. Consult your Cooperative Extension Service for other insecticide recommendations. </em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Slugs: </strong>These pests leave large holes in the foliage or eat leaves entirely. They leave a slime trail, feed at night and are mostly a problem in damp weather.<strong> <em>Burpee Recommends: Hand pick, at night if possible. You can try attracting the slugs to traps either using cornmeal or beer. For a beer trap, dig a hole in the ground and place a large cup or bowl into the hole; use something that has steep sides so that the slugs can&rsquo;t crawl back out when they&rsquo;re finished. Fill the bowl about \u00be of the way full with beer, and let it sit overnight. In the morning, the bowl should be full of drowned slugs that can be dumped out for the birds to eat. For a cornmeal trap, put a tablespoon or two of cornmeal in a jar and put it on its side near the plants. Slugs are attracted to the scent but they cannot digest it and it will kill them. You can also try placing a barrier around your plants of diatomaceous earth or even coffee grounds. They cannot crawl over these.</em></strong><br>\n  <strong><br>\n  Spider Mites: </strong>These tiny spider-like pests are about the size of a grain of pepper. They may be red, black, brown or yellow. They suck on the plant juices removing chlorophyll and injecting toxins which cause white dots on the foliage. There is often webbing visible on the plant. They cause the foliage to turn yellow and become dry and stippled. They multiply quickly and thrive in dry conditions. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Spider mites may be controlled with a forceful spray every other day. Try hot pepper wax or insecticidal soap. Check with your Cooperative Extension Service for miticide recommendations. </em></strong><br>\n<strong><br>\nThrips: </strong>Thrips are tiny needle-thin insects that are black or straw colored. They suck the juices of plants and attack flower petals, leaves and stems. The plant will have a stippling, discolored flecking or silvering of the leaf surface. Thrips can spread many diseases from plant to plant. <strong><em>Burpee Recommends: Many thrips may be repelled by sheets of aluminum foil spread between rows of plants. Remove weeds from the bed and remove debris from the bed after frost. Check with your Cooperative Extension Service for pest controls. </em></strong></p>"
